Brandon; Why do you say that?
Special; SAD
You ; 5Our roommate Chris pulled a total disappearing act...
Kaitlyn; \He's been spending way more time with his football buddies and these girls from Kappa house.
Brandon; HI know how that feels. My ex left me for a guy on the water polo team...
Brandon; VNow his whole Facebook wall is nothing but pics with him and gym bros at frat parties.
Brandon; wTell you what. When you're ready to order, I'll throw in two cookies, free of charge. You look like you could use them.
You ; Thanks, Brandon.

Kaitlyn; UA lot of the guys on the team hook up with the Kappa girls. It's kind of a tradition.
You ; Gross.

You ; HAbout that... Professor Vasquez gave me <i>another</i> crazy assignment.
You ; 8He wants me to <i>rush</i> Becca and Madison's sorority.
Kaitlyn; AHoly crap! Doesn't he know that Becca, you know, hates your guts?
You ; nThat's the whole reason he's making me do this. He says 'the inherent drama will make for a compelling story.'

Option ; ; 1Terrible! I can't believe he's making me do this!
James; ; ; Well, that's the job.
Kaitlyn;  Did <i>you</i> ever rush, James?
James; eOf course not. I had better things to do than kiss up to elitist frat idiots during my freshman year.
You ; XReally? With your high standards, I feel like you'd fit right in with all that snobbery.
James; I--

Kaitlyn; -But you've been fine so far... what happened?
Abbie; nMy little sister just started high school, and she's terrified. She called me in tears during her lunch break.

Abbie; .And now... now I can't be that person anymore.
You ; Oh, Abbie...

Abbie; 5I know. Thanks, guys... agh, this is so embarrassing.
You ; TWe all get a little homesick now and then. You have nothing to be embarrassed about.
Abbie; WI may have yelled at Tyler and Zack to stay out of my room when they came in earlier...
Kaitlyn; EOh, don't worry about them. They're not scarred for life or anything.
Abbie; Oh god. I feel terrible.

Abbie; Maybe just a bit.

Abbie; ; ; ?Oh, give it a rest, you two... I know what you're trying to do.
You ; ; ; cWhat ever could you be referring to? We're just worried about our friend Tyler's delicate feelings!
Abbie; ; ; DOh, really? Then how come you're not worried about <i>Zack</i>, too?
Kaitlyn; ; ; Uhhh...

Customization; iYou cross the room and throw open the doors of the armoire, revealing row after row of beautiful dresses.
Customization; Jackpot!
Customization; /Uh, I'm not sure these will be any use to us...
Customization; 2Did we not come up here to try on Becca's clothes?
Customization; 4Kaitlyn, looking for blackmail was <i>your</i> idea!

Option ; ; The trunk.
Customization; zYou cross the room and throw open the lid of the steamer trunk... to reveal a neatly folded pile of linens and comforters.
Customization; _Wonderful. Becca will have no choice but to accept us once we control her precious bedsheets...
Customization; `What were you expecting to find in there? It's kind of standard practice to put linens in there.
Customization; AI guess I was hoping she'd hidden something embarrassing in here.
Customization;  I think I have just the thing...
Customization; QAbbie shuts the drawer of the vanity and produces a small, leather-bound journal.

Customization; Privacy? What Privacy?
Customization; "You decided to read Becca's diary.
Customization; DShe gave up her right to privacy when she decided to be such a jerk.
Customization; Amen! Let's see...
Customization; IThe three of you spread the diary flat on the vanity and crowd around it.
Customization; N'Another crappy day. Mom and Dad said they'd call, but of course they didn't.'
Customization; e'Going back home for the summer should've been fun, but it just showed me how much they've moved on.'
Customization; 'It's like I disappeared from their lives as soon as I went to college. It makes me wish I could go back to being a kid again.'
Customization; That sounds... familiar.

Customization; &<shake_portrait/>As you <i>should!</i>
Customization; Becca! We... we can explain!

You ; ; ; -We don't exactly have a good excuse for that.
Kaitlyn; ; ; We're really sorry, Becca.
Abbie; ; ; Won't happen again.
Becca; ; ; LI <i>should</i> be pissed off at you... but I have to respect your ambition.

Abbie; ; ; Really?
Becca; ; ; &Really. It's truly baffling. Anyway...
Becca; ; ; aDespite your obvious shortcomings, I like that you three dared to give yourselves the grand tour.

Option ; ; ,Looking for something to blackmail you with.
Customization; Wonderful.
Customization; JSorry, Becca, it's just that we really want to be part of Kappa Phi Sigma.
Customization; *Even if it means playing a little dirty...
Customization; PUgh... I guess I only have myself to blame. I know I'm way too hard on people...
Customization; 0Wait, you <i>know</i> that? And you still do it?
Customization; *It's not like I can help it, <i>Abbie</i>.
Customization; :Weird how you can make my own name sound like an insult...
Customization; %That's sweet of you to say. Anyway...
Customization; kObviously I'm not happy that you guys were going through my stuff looking for blackmailing opportunities...
Customization; }But I also have to respect you for it. Most of the girls downstairs wouldn't even go to the bathroom without my permission...
