James; >I'm sorry, Professor. I tried to tell her you were busy, but--; 
Yasmin; [It's my job to push for what I want, James. It's what makes me the best agent in Manhattan.; 
Vasquez; bI'm afraid you're about forty years too late to sign me. I already have an agent! Charles Wallace!; 
Yasmin; \Charlie retired on Tuesday. I took over his client list and jumped on the first flight here.; 
Yasmin; uI used the plane ride to catch up on your latest book. <i>Very</i> provocative stuff. Especially the {You} character.;
You ; 1Vasquez! You actually named your character {You}?;
Vasquez; RYou should be grateful! You're being immortalized in a work of classic literature!;
Yasmin; \If half the stories I read are true, you've had quite an interesting freshman year so far...;
Choice; Oh yeah?;
Option ; ; It's been pretty fun.
Option ; ; **#What exactly did he write about me?
Option ; ; Those are all lies!
Customization; 'I'm not sure 'fun' is the word I'd use.;
Customization; Huh?;
Customization; 5Never mind, on to business. What do you want, Yasmin?;
Yasmin; ^Oh, I <i>wish</i> I could tell you, but I couldn't possibly violate Vasquez's trust like that.;
You ; MI guess I'll just have to wait for the book to come out like everyone else...;
Vasquez; )On to business. What do you want, Yasmin?;
Customization; <No need to get defensive. You don't even know what he wrote.;
Customization; #Well, I'm sure none of it was good.;
Customization; (That depends on your definition of good.;
Customization; !Enough. What do you want, Yasmin?;
Yasmin; [First, a little bookkeeping. We need to renew publication rights for <i>Winter in July</i>.;
Yasmin; KThat includes going digital! I'm afraid no one reads print anymore, dear...;
Vasquez; çDon't patronize me. Just because our entire culture's sinking into a morass of shallow self-absorption doesn't mean I have to help the slide.;
Yasmin; gAll I need is your signature, Enrique. Then you can go back to your ivory tower and sneer all you want.;
Vasquez; 5I... I'm not ready to sign. I need to think about it.;
Yasmin; âWhat's there to think about? Your book sales could double or even <i>triple</i> if we release <i>Winter in July</i> on digital platforms.;
Vasquez; dI said I need to think about it, okay? As far as I'm concerned, the matter is closed for discussion.;
Vasquez; qI'd rather focus on finishing <i>The Freshman</i>. Hopefully it will serve as a cautionary tale to today's youth.;
You ; Yeah... a cautionary tale.;
Choice; As in...;
Option ; ; **Never trust your professor!
Option ; ; %Try not to date three people at once!
Vasquez; 9You've clearly misidentified the theme of my book, {You}.;
Vasquez; LWhether you trust me or not is a moot point. You <i>have</i> to work for me.;
You ; vSo it's a book about the way millennials are subjugated by a corrupt power structure set up by <i>your</i> generation?;
Vasquez; &Interesting take. I like that angle...;
You ;But... it still ignores the main character's central flaws.;
Customization; 1Heh. I'm not exactly sure I'd call it 'dating...';
Customization; @But that's part of what makes you such an interesting character!;
Customization; <i>I'm not a character!</i>;
Customization; IOn the contrary. You're one of the greatest characters I've ever written.;
Customization; 2You're a flawed protagonist worthy of Shakespeare.;
You ; :What flaws? I bet you can't even come up with one example.;
Vasquez; zActually, I've got half a book's worth of examples. And by the end of the year, I should have enough to finish this thing.;
Yasmin; :I take that to mean, you don't have any more pages for me?;
Vasquez; ?Actually... I'm just getting an idea for my next chapter now...;
Vasquez; IOf course, this is going to require a bit of 'help' from {You} and James.;
James; IWhoa, whoa, whoa. Leave me out of this. I'm your mentee, not your puppet.;
Vasquez; RHear me out. There's a nice benefit in this for you, if you play your cards right.;
Vasquez; UHere's my proposal: {You} is going to put on James's play, here on campus, next week!;
Vasquez; UAnd Yasmin here is going to watch. If she likes it, she'll take James on as a client!;
Yasmin; I will?;
Vasquez; âThink of the drama! James's future on the line... an agent out to land her first client after inheriting a bunch of literary dinosaurs...;
Vasquez; fAnd at the center of it all, a girl who risks losing her scholarship and getting thrown out of school!;
Yasmin; =That <i>does</i> sound compelling. Very well, then. I accept.;
Yasmin; TI'll look forward to watching your play, Mr. Ashton. It had better be worth my time.;
You ; PHow am I supposed to put on a play just like that? I don't even know any actors!;
Vasquez; 'Oh, you won't be using actors, {You}...;
Vasquez; ^The stars of <i>this</i> play will be a few of my favorite characters... you and your friends!;

Customization; kAs you and Chris walk across the quad, you stop by the frozen fountain and look down at the glistening ice.;
Customization; GIt seems like a long time ago since we had a slip 'n slide set up here.;
Customization; $Yeah. The campus looks so different.;
Customization; -I guess a lot has changed since fall quarter.;
Customization; Not everything.;
Customization; WChris takes your hand and leads you to a booth serving roasted chestnuts and hot cocoa.;
Customization; YMmm... maybe it's just because I'm freezing, but this is the best thing I've ever tasted.;
Customization; MIf you're cold, it's the perfect time for me to give you your Christmas gift!;
Customization; @Chris reaches into his backpack and produces a crinkled package.;
Customization; I, uh, wrapped it myself.;
Customization; >You tear open the paper to reveal a pair of soft, wool gloves.;
Customization; UWow... these are the softest gloves I've ever owned! And they're just the right size!;
Customization; (I can't take all of the credit for that.;
Customization; yI got them at the clothing shop where my mom works... I showed her a picture of you, and she was able to guess your size.;
Customization; That's a pretty neat trick.;
Customization; I'll tell her you said that.;
Customization; I didn't realize your mom works in a clothing store. I guess I don't really hear that many stories about your life back home...;
Customization; NI... don't like to talk about it. But I'll tell you anything you want to know.;
Customization; Tell me about...;
Customization; Your family.;
Customization; Your hometown.;
Customization; Your break.;
Customization; NLet's see... there's me. My mom. My brother Kyle is 10, and my sister Jo is 8.;
