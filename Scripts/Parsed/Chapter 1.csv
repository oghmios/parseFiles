Chris;Whoa!;;;
Narrator;You're both knocked off your feet.;;;
You ; I'm so sorry! Are you okay?;;;
Chris; My ego's a little bruised.;;;
Chris;If the other guys on the football team saw me get tackled by a pretty girl, they'd never let me forget it.;;;

Kaitlyn;Here's your room. Hurry up and change, then we can hit the Welcome Week Fair!;;;
Kaitlyn;Oh, I almost forgot! Every year, they set up a massive slip 'n slide in the middle of the fair!;;;
Kaitlyn;It looks super fun... and it's a great excuse to wear a bikini!;;;
You ; So... are you going to do it?;;;
Kaitlyn;Definitely. You only get one chance to make a first impression.;;;
Kaitlyn;Sliding through the quad in a sexy swimsuit is a great way to make an entrance.;;;

; ; Text from other option; ;A few minutes later, Kaitlyn returns.
; ; Text from other option; ;Oh! You're still... wearing the same thing.
; ; Text from other option; ;I'm not going to change. The truth is that this awful girl named Becca threw coffee on me within, like, five seconds of meeting me.
; ; Text from other option; ;Yikes. I'm sorry, Jourdan.
; ; Text from other option; ;Don't be. I'm not. And now I'll wear this stain as a badge of honor.
; ; Text from other option; ;I think people will just assume that you spilled on yourself, though...
; ; Text from other option; ;Well... I'll know the truth!
; ; Text from other option; ;And that's what counts.

Logan;Who's that girl? She's like... a slip 'n slide angel!;;;
Chris; That's Jourdan. She's the one I was telling you about.;;;
Logan; No fair. How come beautiful girls never knock me over?;;;
Narrator;Just then, Kaitlyn runs up with a couple of snow cones and hands you one.;;;
Kaitlyn;I don't know what flavor you like, so I just got rainbow.;;;

Narrator;Just then, you spot a familiar face at the Kappa Phi Sigma booth...;;;
You ;Becca.;;;
Becca;Jourdan. Could you not stand so close to our tent?;;;
Becca; We don't want people thinking Kappa Phi Sigma would associate with someone like you.;;;
Kaitlyn;Wow, Jourdan, is this girl serious?;;;
You ; Unfortunately.;;;
Becca; Time to move along.;;;
Madison;Are you sure, Becca? I mean, look at her bikini... it's pure hotness!;;;
Madison;Aren't we basically honor bound to sign her up?;;;

; ; Text from other option; ;Ugh, never mind! Let's get out of here, Kaitlyn.
Becca; That's what I thought. Buh bye.;;;

Kaitlyn;Well, that was interesting...;;;
Kaitlyn;Looks like Ms. Queen Bee was completely jealous of your look!;;;
You;Is that what just happened?;;;
Kaitlyn;Totally. She knew you were a threat, and she lashed out.;;;
