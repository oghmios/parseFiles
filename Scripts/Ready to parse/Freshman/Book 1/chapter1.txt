BG_EXT_CAMPUS_QUAD_DAY
XWelcome to Hartfeld University, one of North America's most elite academic institutions!

Ready to choose your look?
GIt's the first day of college, and you walk across a bustling campus...
ZUgh. This suitcase weighs like a thousand pounds. Maybe I shouldn't have brought so much--
	SURPRISED

=As you round a corner, you smack right into a guy jogging by!
Chris
<shake_portrait/>Whoa!
"You're both knocked off your feet.
I'm so sorry! Are you okay?

My ego's a little bruised.
jIf the other guys on the football team saw me get tackled by a pretty girl, they'd never let me forget it.
HAPPY
&He offers you a hand and helps you up.
(I'm Chris, by the way. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too. I'm...
Enter your name.
 
0{You}... for some reason that rings a bell. Huh.
+So... are you okay? Nothing broken, I hope.
2I'll be fine. My hand is just a little scraped up.
0Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?

You've just met your first potential love interest! You'll meet more later. For now, it's up to you how to respond...
Well, you could...
NEUTRAL
Help me with my bag.
 Kiss my hand and make it better.
*Get on your knees and beg for forgiveness.
4Chris looks down at your bag, which has popped open.
Whoa! Your stuff is everywhere.
?Chris picks up a lacy black bra. Then his face goes bright red.
3Oh... wow. I didn't mean to... Uh... is this yours?
FYou grab the bra out of his hands, and stuff it back in your suitcase.
'I think that's enough help for one day!
Relationship Improved
.Your relationship with Chris will be affected.
If that'll help...
-He lifts your hand to his lips and kisses it.
It feels better already.
.Any other bumps or bruises you need me to fix?

Let me think about that...
Chris gets down on one knee.
{You}, will you accept my--
Edgar
JOh wow! <jiggle>Spontaneous proposal.</jiggle> I gotta get this on camera!
Student
No! Wait. It's not like that!
Uh, maybe I should stand up.

You think?

Becca
GChris! There you are! Don't forget about the Kappa house mixer tonight.
UOh... Becca. Hey. I'd love to go, but I promised my roommates I'd hang out with them.
FToo bad... I <i>promise</i> you'd have a better time with <i>me</i>...
4Uh, we're kind of in the middle of a conversation...
SAD
+It looked to me like you were just leaving.
ANGRY

Actually--
OJust then, Becca drops her iced coffee at your feet, splashing it all over you.

<i>Seriously?!</i>
Oops. I'm so clumsy!
.{You}! Your outfit! I'll go find some napkins.
+As soon as he's gone, Becca leans in close.
 Just so you know, Chris is mine.
Oh, he's your boyfriend?
Not yet. But he will be.
Oh yeah?
*I couldn't care less about your love life.
News flash... Chris is mine!
$Forget Chris! What about my clothes?
1Good. Just stay out of my way, and we'll be fine.
)Chris is <i>clearly</i> way more into me.
$As if <i>that</i> would be possible!
)I spent all morning choosing this outfit.
%And that's what you wore? How... sad.
,Chris runs up with a stack of paper napkins.
This is the best I could do.
MIt's a good start... I'll just find my dorm and change. See you around, okay?
You can count on it.
A few minutes later...

This looks like the place!
5You knock on the door, which swings open to reveal...
BG_INT_DORM_MAIN_DAY
Wow.
This place is huge!
Kaitlyn
+Aaaahhhhh! New roomie! You're finally here!
...and covered in coffee?
2Haven't you heard? It's the hottest look for fall.
VOh yeah? Well you're definitely pulling it off. Seriously, you're <i>super</i> pretty.
	Thanks...
I am super pretty.
You're super hot!
$I can tell we're going to get along.
Not exactly modest, are you?
Should I be?
Good point.
uHere, let me help with those bags... I'm sure you want to find your room and get out of those coffee-stained clothes.
Relationship Improved
0Your relationship with Kaitlyn will be affected.

Oh, wow...
@Kaitlyn blushes and looks away, a slight smile curving her lips.
	Too much?
I'm gonna go with <i>no</i>.
_But you probably want to get out of those coffee-stained clothes. Let me show you to your room!

Yay, roomies!
#Kaitlyn pulls you into a tight hug!
 Oops... forgot about the coffee!
"Sorry... I should probably change.
!Sure, I'll show you to your room!
$Kaitlyn leads you through the suite.
1Wait... do we have this whole place to ourselves?
dHa! I wish. In case you haven't heard, the school's in a housing crunch. This is a six-person suite!
IWe'll be sharing this place with one other girl... and <i>three guys!</i>
	That's...
Awesome!
	Horrible!
Sexy!
HThis is great! It'll be like having five best friends right off the bat!
dJust friends? They say the number one rule of freshman year is not to hook up with your roommates...
%But I don't always play by the rules.
I'll keep that in mind.
II can't believe I have to share this place with a bunch of gross dudes...
.I feel like I just joined a frat or something.
IAw, they're not <i>so</i> bad. You'll like them once you meet, I promise.
l<i>And</i> if they ever get to be too much, we can lock them out of the suite and have a girls' night. Deal?
Deal.
TI wonder if I'll hook up with <i>all</i> of our roommates, or just a couple of them.
JThey say the number one rule of freshman year is not to do exactly that...
%But I don't always play by the rules.
I'll keep that in mind.
BG_INT_DORM_BEDROOM_DAY
MHere's your room. Hurry up and change, then we can hit the Welcome Week Fair!
fOh, I almost forgot! Every year, they set up a <i>massive</i> slip 'n slide in the middle of the fair!
LIt looks super fun... and it's a great excuse to wear a <aqua>bikini!</aqua>
So... are you going to do it?
?Definitely. You only get one chance to make a first impression.
VSliding through the quad in a sexy swimsuit is a <i>great</i> way to make an entrance.
,I'm gonna go change! Be back in a sec, okay?

What do you think?
8I think I'm roommates with the hottest girl at Hartfeld!
You don't look so bad yourself.

Ready to go make a splash?
Let's do this.
HYou change out of your coffee-stained clothes and pull on a cute blouse.
What do you think?
IIt's an improvement... but I'm not sure it's right for the slip 'n slide.
JHeh. Probably not. I'll let you do the sliding for both of us today, okay?
 Whatever you say. Let's do this!
%A few minutes later, Kaitlyn returns.
+Oh! You're still... wearing the same thing.
ŠI'm <i>not</i> going to change. The truth is that this awful girl named Becca threw coffee on me within, like, five seconds of meeting me.
Yikes. I'm sorry, {You}.
DDon't be. I'm not. And now I'll wear this stain as a badge of honor.
GI think people will just assume that you spilled on yourself, though...
#Well... <i>I'll</i> know the truth!
And that's what counts.
KYou're an inspiration to us all. Now let's go check out that slip 'n slide!
<Heh. I'll let you do the sliding for both of us today, okay?

†Outside, you find dozens of people manning booths for various organizations. Onlookers cheer as freshmen coast down the slip 'n slide!
Here goes nothing!
SKaitlyn gets a running start and jumps onto the slip 'n slide! The crowd goes wild.
Madison
 Woo! I'm loving that confidence!
Tripp
	Marry me!
My turn.
?You sprint across the grass and dive head-first onto the slide.
&This... is... <jiggle>college!<jiggle>
EAs you reach the end of the slide, you hear people talking about you.

<Who's that girl? She's like... a slip 'n slide <i>angel!</i>
Relationship Improved
.Your relationship with Chris will be affected.
4That's {You}. She's the one I was telling you about.
=No fair. How come beautiful girls never knock <i>me</i> over?
IJust then, Kaitlyn runs up with a couple of snow cones and hands you one.
9I don't know what flavor you like, so I just got rainbow.
Thanks!
4I've never seen someone so happy to get a snow cone.
I'm smiling because...
I think a cute guy is into me!
I'm happy to be here with you!

SNOW CONE!
]This morning, I ran into this super cute guy, and I just overheard him talking to his friend.
I'd love to meet him...
NYou look over to where Chris had been standing, but you don't see him anymore.
I guess it'll have to wait.

I'll look forward to it...
Aw! You're super sweet...
And I feel the same way.
(Maybe it's destiny that we're roommates.
I think you might be right.
!<jiggle>Snooow coooonne!</jiggle>
(<jiggle>Snooooooow cooooonnnne!</jiggle>

Snow cone?
1We're having a moment here, dude. Leave us alone.
JAfter taking a few minutes to dry off, you and Kaitlyn check out the fair.
She jogs back to you.
/Okay. I have to admit, that looked pretty cool.
WThanks. And don't worry. You'll have plenty of chances to impress people around here...
IAfter Kaitlyn dries off, the two of you check out the booths at the fair.

MUSIC_COLLEGE_ACTION_CHILL
RLet's see here... a capella? Nah. Can't sing. Student government? Nah. Don't care.
CJust then, you spot a familiar face at the Kappa Phi Sigma booth...

<i>Becca.</i>
0{You}. Could you not stand so close to our tent?
[We don't want people thinking Kappa Phi Sigma would associate with someone like <i>you</i>.
!Wow, {You}, is this girl serious?
Unfortunately.
Time to move along.
EAre you sure, Becca? I mean, look at her bikini... it's pure hotness!
/Aren't we basically honor bound to sign her up?
5Madison, would you <i>please</i> stop undermining me?
lDon't worry, Becca. I'm not interested in joining any sorority that associates with someone like <i>you</i>.
Time to move along.
DYeah, her outfit is putting me to sleep. Wake me up when she's gone.
3Don't worry, we're not planning on sticking around.
Time to move along.
fYeah, we're not exactly looking for pledges who are covered in coffee... that <i>is</i> coffee, right?
MThe only reason I'm covered in coffee is because <i>Becca</i> threw it on me!
SSounds like you need to ask yourself why people want to throw coffee at you, {You}.
	What? I--
0Ugh, never mind! Let's get out of here, Kaitlyn.
That's what I thought. Buh bye.
<Becca smirks at you and sips an iced coffee through a straw.
$I see you got a new coffee, Becca...
(What should I do?)
'Accidentally' spill it on her!
Take the high road.
BYou knock your hand against Becca's cup, spilling it all over her!
<jiggle>Ahhhhhh!</i>
KYou should be more careful. Coffee stains are <i>super</i> hard to get out.
?You're going to regret this... you just made an enemy for life.
/Eh. It seemed like you already hated me anyway.
Get. Away. From. Me.
0Becca, people are starting to avoid our booth...
Shut up, Madison!
.I guess this is where <i>we</i> say 'buh bye.'
*As you leave, Kaitlyn flashes you a smile.
RMs. Queen Bee was completely jealous of your look... AND you doused her in coffee!
Dress to Impress!
"Your bikini won you an enemy! Yay?
Trust me, she had it coming.
WI can't believe it... your first day and you've already got a nemesis. You're so lucky!
...
6Are you just going to stand there and look depressing?
I'll stand wherever I want.
%Becca takes a long sip of her coffee.
I said <i>buh bye.</i>
,Fine. I'm going. But only because I want to.
Well, that was interesting...
=Looks like Ms. Queen Bee was completely jealous of your look!
Is that what just happened?
8Totally. She knew you were a threat, and she lashed out.
Dress to Impress!
"Your bikini won you an enemy! Yay?
WI can't believe it... your first day and you've already got a nemesis. You're so lucky!
,As you leave, Kaitlyn flashes you a grimace.
@A couple of Chanel skirts and they think they're better than us.
Are they wrong?
COf course they're wrong. But don't worry... we'll have our revenge.
We will?
(I don't know, I was just being dramatic.
Ahh, gotcha.
CAs you prepare to head back to your dorm, you look across the quad.
James
...
???
See something you like?
You mean that guy?
He's not my type.
He's TOTALLY my type.
$If it's got a pulse, I'm interested.
(A girl with high standards... I like it.
)This day keeps getting better and better.

The guy looks over at you.
...
???
Mystery Man!

You caught some attention!
@Okay, he's definitely checking you out... and who can blame him?
#You look super cute in that bikini!
...
???
KI don't think he noticed me... maybe I should have worn a different outfit.
NA moment later, the guy walks into a nearby building and disappears from view.
SHey, it's getting dark, and I just got a text from our roommates! They're all home!
0Sounds like it's time to head back to the suite.
AA few minutes later, you change back into some regular clothes...

lAs the sun sets, you walk into your dorm living room and find a girl standing in front of a painter's easel.
Abbie
"Hey, you must be {You}. I'm Abbie.
&You reach forward to shake her hand...
Y<shake_portrait/>Ah! Careful! I'm covered in paint, and I don't want to ruin your outfit!

DAnyway, the guys are all up on the roof. I'll catch up to you later.
KNo way! You're coming with us, Abbie... you can finish your painting later!

So? What's your review, {You}?
!It looks <i>amazing</i>, Abbie...
I was just wondering...
%Where'd you learn to paint like that?
!Are you the girl in the painting?
%Abbie blushes and looks at the floor.
KI may have spent every lunch period in the art studio during high school...
WMy art teacher was a big influence on me. She really helped me find my style, you know?
MThat's so cool! The closest thing I had to a mentor in high school was Cosmo.
6Well, I guess we find inspiration where we can, right?
%Abbie blushes and looks at the floor.

Uh... maybe? I don't know.
}I've heard it's impossible to keep yourself out of your work... and I was definitely super into fairytales when I was little.
Aww! That's adorable.
[So, it's sort of a self-portrait of the artist as a young girl... plus fairytale creatures?
Sort of, yeah.
CSo! <i>Now</i> are you ready to come up to the roof with us, Abbie?
