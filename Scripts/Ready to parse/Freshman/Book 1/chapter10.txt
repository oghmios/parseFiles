"Chapter Ten: Sorority Ball, Part 2
The Freshman
BG_INT_SORORITY_HOUSE_NIGHT
iAt the Kappa Phi Sigma sorority ball, you walk over to Kaitlyn and lean against the banister next to her.
Hey, Kaitlyn... you okay?
	SURPRISED
Kaitlyn
Yeah, I'm fine...
SAD
ªWeird night, huh? You would not believe the drama I'm dealing with right now. James and I kind of had a moment out there, and <i>Chris</i> saw it and wanted to talk to me alone, and now--
qYou notice Kaitlyn studiously not making eye contact with you, her gaze drifting across the throng of partygoers.
Are you sure you're okay?
AKaitlyn turns to look at you, a tiny crease between her eyebrows.
HSorry, {You}. I just... I don't know if I can hear about this right now.
What... what do you mean?
*I... never mind. It's too hard to explain.
So... what happened with Chris?
(What should I do?)
NEUTRAL
&Tell Kaitlyn about my talk with Chris.
%Press Kaitlyn about how she's acting.
chris_regret
@Well, we talked, and... I think part of him wants to be with me.
@It's almost like... like he's punishing himself by dating Becca.
GNo one deserves that much punishment. I <i>almost</i> feel bad for him.
ÖWell, nothing, <i>really</i> happened... I told him we had nothing to talk about. But... he said he wished things had been different.
OSo... moving on. How are you feeling about the guy you actually came here with?
BThere was <i>definitely</i> a moment with James tonight. I just...
#I don't know what to think anymore.
Yeah, I know how that feels.
What do you mean?
%Oh my god, do you <i>like</i> Darren?
HAPPY
No, I--

Forget it.
DForget about Chris. What's going on with <i>you</i>? You seem upset.
.I... don't worry about it. I just feel like...
I<i>Ugh!</i> This is way too hard to explain. Can we just drop it for now?
1Okay... you know you can tell me anything, right?
Yeah... sure. Anything.
™Just then, Darren returns from the kitchen with an old-fashioned in one hand and a lemon drop in the other. He hands Kaitlyn the lemon drop, and she takes a grateful sip.
Darren
VHey, {You}. Sorry, I would've gotten you something if I knew you were hanging with us.

And if I had a third hand.
Oh, don't worry about--
jKaitlyn suddenly grabs Darren's sleeve with her free hand, cutting you off before you can finish speaking.
IDarren, do you want to go for a walk? I bet the stars look great tonight.
)Sure, let's do it. See you around, {You}.
Right...
See you around.
aMore confused than ever, you wander across the dance floor to where James waits talking to Abbie.
James
,Hey, {You}... you okay? You look a little...
Abbie
 Befuddled. Bothered. Bewildered.

Yeah, something like that.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_LOVE
 Maybe a dance will cheer you up?
It's certainly worth a shot...
FOne sec, James... I want to talk to {You} alone real quick. That okay?
Sure, she's all yours.
(Abbie pulls you aside, smiling brightly.
What'd you want to talk about?
xI just wanted to say... James is awesome! He's been really sweet to me all evening, and he <i>obviously</i> likes you...
7Plus, he's super hot, but I'm sure you've noticed that.
Yeah, he's definitely...
Boyfriend material.
1A nice guy, but I'm not sure how into him I am...
:Cool. Glad you agree. Just wanted to give you my blessing.
 Thanks, Abbie. Much appreciated.
0Oh, okay. Well, I was really impressed by him...
!And I think he's really into you.
If you say so...
iI just wish I knew what was going on with Kaitlyn. Have you noticed she's been acting kind of... distant?
VYeah, I feel like something is going on with her.... where'd she disappear to, anyway?
"She went for a walk with Darren...
DMaybe we should try to go listen in on what they're talking about...
MIf we don't go now, we might never figure out what secret Kaitlyn is keeping!
 I am pretty worried about her...
Let's see what we can find out!
kaitlyn_eavesdrop
But let's just stay inside.
Gathering Intel
$You decided to eavesdrop on Kaitlyn!
NWe're doing this for our friend. Not cause we're nosy or anything like that...
QYou don't have to convince <i>me</i>. Hopefully we'll learn what's up with her...
Respecting Boundaries
(You decided not to eavesdrop on Kaitlyn.
guessed_kaitlyn
:I'd rather Kaitlyn tell me what's bothering her herself...
$Sometimes it's not that easy, {You}.
Yeah... I guess so.
BG_EXT_SORORITY_HOUSE_NIGHT
aYou and Abbie sneak out into the garden of the Kappa Phi Sigma house and hide behind some bushes.
\Nearby, Darren and Kaitlyn sit on the lip of the fountain, looking up at the stars overhead.
;Why aren't they talking? Or making out? Or <i>anything</i>?
Shhhh, they'll hear you!
DSo, I know you didn't actually bring me out here to look at stars...
You do?
I'm perceptive like that.
;I can tell something's bothering you, Kaitlyn... what's up?
Why'd you rush us out of there?
>Ugh, it's... it's complicated. Just... stupid emotional stuff.
I love stupid emotional stuff.
rListen, Darren, I really appreciate how nice you're being... but I'm not really looking for a boyfriend right now.
Uh oh...
gI know that. Kappa Phi Sigma always makes their pledges find an upperclassman to take them to the ball.
NAll I'm trying to do right now is help you with whatever's got you down. Okay?
7Okay. Well, if you're sure you want to hear about it...
	I'm sure.
xThe truth is... I'm crushing pretty hard on one of my roommates. I told myself not to, but... that didn't work, I guess.
UI want to tell them how I feel... but I'm scared it'll ruin our friendship. You know?
Whoa, this is <i>major!</i>
Yeah... I wonder who it is?
bThat's rough, Kaitlyn. I haven't been in that exact situation... but I have been in a similar one.
oAnd my take on it is this... if you can't tell someone how you feel, then your friendship's already in trouble.
FI know it's scary, but I think you should just come out and tell them.
Are you sure?
sPositive. Besides... they could be feeling the same way. You don't want them to beat you to the confession, do you?
-That's an interesting way of looking at it...
I'm a competitive guy.
So... you feeling any better?
Much.
]Good. Let's go back inside... I think Becca's planning to announce which pledges got in soon.
FAfter Darren and Kaitlyn go back inside, Abbie turns to you wide-eyed.
OHoly crap! I wish she'd said who she was crushing on... who do you think it is?
Who do you think Kaitlyn likes?
Confirm
Chris
Confirm
Confirm
Tyler
Confirm
Zack
Confirm
9Chris? But... what about his whole thing with <i>you</i>?
hThat's probably why she wouldn't tell me what was going on with her. She's worried I'd be mad if I knew.
âYeah, maybe... but she said she was worried about ruining her friendship with the person. Kaitlyn and Chris have never been that close...
Hmm... good point...
 <i>Me?!</i> Why do you say that?
SShe seems to care a lot about you. Don't tell me you haven't noticed <i>that</i>...
fWell, yeah, but that's just being a good friend. Besides, she's always pushing me to get with Tyler...
"Hmm... I guess you have a point...
&You think she likes <i>Tyler</i>? Why?
3I don't know... she talks about him a lot, I guess.
AYeah, in the context of trying to get <i>me</i> to ask him out...
$Hmmm... okay, that's a good point...
*<i>Zack?</i> But he's not even into girls!
6I know! That's what makes this so complicated for her.
±I don't know, {You}. She said she was worried about ruining the friendship... I think it would be a lot more complicated than <i>that</i> if Zack was the one she had a crush on.
(Hmmm... I guess you make a good point...
PYou know... I wasn't sure if I should say anything, but that'd be my guess, too.
Really?
gTotally! You two have been close since day one, and after that game of Truth or Dare the other night...
(Yeah... that's what I was thinking, too.
RSo... how do you feel about her? You don't have to tell me if you don't want to...
I...
@Feel the same way. I just don't know if I'm ready to tell her...
"Need some time to figure this out.
Don't feel the same way.
Friend Crush
+You told Abbie you have a crush on Kaitlyn!
5That's great! And you should <i>totally</i> tell her.
+I totally understand. It's a lot to absorb.
(Ah. This must be awkward for you then...
lJust then, you hear the music switch off in the sorority house as everyone gathers around Becca and Madison.
éUh oh... we'd better get back inside before anyone notices we're missing. Sounds like they're going to announce who made the cut any second...
Madison
MadisonFormal
MUSIC_COLLEGE_FUN_CHILL
nAs the clock strikes midnight, Becca clinks a fork against her champagne glass to gather everyone's attention.
*Ooh, they're about to announce who got in!
"Hey, Kaitlyn. Back from your walk?
HYeah... sorry about earlier. Turns out I just needed someone to talk to.
Happy to be of service.
Oh... great!
Everything okay?
I'm not sure, actually...
Nervous about getting in?
YAre you just doing this for Vasquez, or do you really want to be part of Kappa Phi Sigma?
To be totally honest...
I'm starting to see the appeal.
<I'm pretty pissed at Vasquez for making me put up with this.
,They definitely know how to throw a party...
0Yeah, I figured this wasn't really your scene...

MUSIC_COLLEGE_TENSE_ACTION
Becca
Ahem. Quiet down, everyone.
ANGRY
;The moment you've all been waiting for has finally arrived!
oBecca and Madison retreat into a back room and return holding tall, thin candles topped with flickering flames.
hThe time has come to announce which of our remaining pledges will become full Kappa Phi Sigma sisters...
Ooh, I can't wait to find out!
Don't you already know?
Well, yeah... but I forgot!
KOh my god, Madison. Anyway, the pledges that we've decided to accept are...
Kaitlyn!
Eeeee! I knew it!
<i>Yes!</i>
Congratulations!
sorority_score
{You}!
Sorority Star
!You made it into Kappa Phi Sigma!
&Aw, {You}! We're sorority sisters now!
$Great! Definitely a dream come true.
$That'd better not be sarcasm, {You}.
achievement_rush_hour
Anyone else, Becca?
MUSIC_COLLEGE_TENSE_SAD
Hmm, let me see...
...
Nope! That's everyone!
But... what about Abbie?
What about her?
{You}, it's okay...
Why wasn't she accepted?
NOh, {You}... don't make me humiliate Abbie in front of all of our nice guests.
ùAbbie's just not Kappa Phi Sigma material. You think I didn't notice she showed up without a date? Plus she spent half the dance standing around awkwardly...
FThe only reason anyone danced with her tonight was out of <i>pity</i>.
Don't listen to her, Abbie.
Can't we vouch for her?
,That seems fair... what do you think, Becca?
=Hmm, I'm afraid that wouldn't work. It's just not a good fit.
Okay...
BThen you can forget about me joining your stupid sorority. I quit.
Sorry, Abbie...
sorority_acceptance
MUSIC_COLLEGE_ACTION_FUN
*Becca glares at you through narrowed eyes.
(Are you sure you want to do this, {You}?
PI didn't even want to be part of this to begin with. Come on, Kaitlyn, let's go.
Maybe we could talk about this?

Seriously?
-Uh, no. You're right, of course you're right.
XYou jerks can keep your delicious champagne and your super cute dresses! I'm outta here!
No, Kaitlyn!
2This hurts me as much as it hurts you, believe me.
,Well, I appreciate the sacrifice... I think.
tLet's go back to the suite, Abbie. Any sorority that doesn't accept you isn't worth joining as far as I'm concerned.
Thanks, {You}.
#And... thank you, Kaitlyn. Sort of.
You're welcome.
3Aw, boo! You're not <i>really</i> leaving, are you?
%Good riddance. See you never, losers.
Right back at you.
Not Without My Abbie
5You stood up for Abbie and abandoned Kappa Phi Sigma!
ñYou, Abbie, and Kaitlyn stride out of the sorority house and out of Kappa Phi Sigma forever, Kaitlyn throwing one last longing look over her shoulder.
=Goodbye, Sunday brunches. Goodbye, awesome parties. Goodbye--
Okay, Kaitlyn, we get it.
We'll make sure your birthday party this weekend is extra special, okay? It'll be way more awesome than any party Kappa Phi Sigma can throw.
Deal!
gUp ahead, James and Darren walk side by side, an affable silence between them. You catch Kaitlyn's eye.
=So... are you going to tell us about your 'walk' with Darren?
+Oh, <i>that</i>. I had a feeling you'd ask.
	Darren...

Is so hot!
Definitely seems nice...
)Maybe. But I have my eye on someone else.
|Kaitlyn flashes a mischievous smile and quickens her pace, falling into step with Darren. He puts a friendly arm around her.
BG_EXT_CAMPUS_QUAD_NIGHT
Hey, Kaitlyn. Feeling better?
cBig time. Thanks again. I know you probably didn't expect to spend all night <i>talking</i>, but...
.Hey, I get it. Sometimes that's what you need.
When are you going to tell her?
>Soon... but I'm kind of enjoying having a secret. Is that bad?
,Abbie rolls her eyes and suppresses a snort.
You two deserve each other.
(Still trying to figure out how you feel?
4Yup... everything's just been so confusing lately...
.I know what you mean. Speaking of confusing...
Hey, {You}.
6Have you figured out how you're going to let her down?
ENo... I'm not sure what say. This night only gets more complicated...
0I know what you mean. Speaking of complicated...
Hey, {You}.
&This night only gets more confusing...
,Abbie rolls her eyes and suppresses a snort.
Oh, {You}. Poor, sweet {You}...
&What is <i>that</i> supposed to mean?!
%Oh, nothing. Speaking of confusing...
Hey, {You}.
SJames hangs back to talk to you, and Abbie speeds up, leaving the two of you alone.
9That was pretty rough back there. How are you holding up?
Take a wild guess.
…Yeah... I know that wasn't exactly how you wanted the evening to go. Unfortunately, Becca is just the least of your worries... Vasquez is going to be <i>pissed</i> that you didn't join Kappa Phi Sigma.
¡But I didn't even <i>want</i> to join Kappa Phi Sigma in the first place, and after they rejected Abbie I was even <i>less</i> interested. Vasquez just made me rush for his stupid <i>story</i>.
5I'm starting to feel like this might not be worth it.
bBetween you and me, I think he asked a little too much of you this time. But on the bright side...
ñWhat you did for Abbie was pretty amazing. Walking out like that when you'd already been accepted, risking Vasquez's disappointment... that took guts.
DThanks, James... I just hope Vasquez isn't <i>too</i> angry with me.
VYou sigh heavily and look out over the moonlit campus, your brow creased with worry...
BBecause if he is... I might not be attending Hartfeld much longer.
)Abbie stares at you, blinking back tears.
Fine. I guess...
I guess I'll be going, then.
Abbie, wait--
OAbbie turns and runs out the door of the sorority house and out into the night.
Abbie!
Is she going to be okay?
uOh, forget about her. This sisterhood is much better off without her. And <i>you two</i> are much better off with us.
Yeah... I guess so.
Social Climber
0You abandoned Abbie to get into Kappa Phi Sigma!
{After the ceremony, you and Kaitlyn sit out on the front steps of Kappa Phi Sigma house and look out at the starlit campus.
=We can talk to her later. She'll have to understand... right?
tI hope so. I was really looking forward to the three of us hanging out at my birthday party this weekend, but now...
)I'm just not sure she'll even want to go.
(Don't worry. We'll figure something out.
KHey, Kaitlyn, {You}... are you gonna let James and I walk you home or what?
Uh, sure... be right there!
gYou and Kaitlyn get up off the steps and start heading back, trailing a little behind Darren and James.
=So... are you going to tell me about your 'walk' with Darren?
+Oh, <i>that</i>. I had a feeling you'd ask.
	Darren...

Is so hot!

.Hey, I get it. Sometimes that's what you need.
 James hangs back to talk to you.
@That was pretty rough back there, {You}. How are you holding up?
Take a wild guess.
)Yeah... I know that can't have felt good.
[You think? I sold out one of my only friends here just so Vasquez can get his <i>story</i>.
1Starting to feel like this might not be worth it.
nBetween you and me, I think he went too far this time. But on the bright side... Abbie's going to come around.
%How can you <i>know</i> that, though?
äShe knows what this means to you, {You}. She may be feeling hurt and angry now, but... she knows this is what you have to do to stay here.
0It might take some time, but she'll forgive you.
HYou just have to focus on staying on her good side until she learns how.
QThanks, James. I don't know if you're right, but... it sure makes me feel better.
0You're actually pretty nice when you want to be.
Don't get used to it.
Anyone else, Becca?
Hmm, let me see...
Nope! That's everyone!
What about {You} and Abbie?
What about them?
Kaitlyn, it's okay...
_Actually, it's not. I'd like to hear which of your insane standards I didn't live up to, Becca.
LOh, {You}... don't make me humiliate you in front of all of our nice guests.
Please, go right ahead.
mFrankly, after watching you two over the past few days, you and Abbie simply aren't Kappa Phi Sigma material.
Blackballed
(You didn't make it into Kappa Phi Sigma.
LAnd this little performance you're giving is <i>certainly</i> proof of that.
kYou glare at Becca as she continues listing your and Abbie's shortcomings, until Kaitlyn clears her throat.
#Uh, Becca? Could you maybe shut up?
0<i>Excuse</i> me? What did you just say, pledge?
4I said shut up. And I'm <i>not</i> a pledge anymore.
Yeah, she's a sister now!
 That's not what I meant. I quit.
<i>What?</i>
`I quit. I don't want to be part of this anymore, especially if it means being around <i>you</i>.

Kaitlyn...
 You don't have to quit for us...
[I know I don't have to. But if the alternative is putting up with this brat all the time...
It's an easy choice.
3Aw, boo! You're not <i>really</i> leaving, are you?
%Good riddance. See you never, losers.
Right back at you.
Worth It
4Kaitlyn abandoned Kappa Phi Sigma for you and Abbie!
éYou, Abbie, and Kaitlyn stride out of the sorority house and out of Kappa Phi Sigma forever, Kaitlyn throwing one last look over her shoulder.
