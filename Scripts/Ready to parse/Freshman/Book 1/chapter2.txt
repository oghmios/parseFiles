!Chris? <i>You're</i> my roommate?
	SURPRISED
Chris
HThat's why I recognized the name {You}! Nice to see you again... roomie!
HAPPY
Yeah... great to see you too.
KSo... what about this roof, huh? You can see the whole town from up here...
Yeah! So beautiful...

Zack
7'Beautiful'? I can only assume you're talking about me.

I wasn't--
FI'm just messing with you. I know, I know, I can come on a bit strong.
welcome_outfit
mThe name's Zack, but you can call me your number one fan cause you are straight-up <i>crushing</i> that look.
Coffee stains and all.
mThe name's Zack, but you can call me your number one fan cause you are straight-up <i>crushing</i> that look.
Nice to meet you...
NEUTRAL
Now stop hitting on me!
 It sounds like you know fashion!
!You don't look so bad yourself...
1Whoa, I definitely was <i>not</i> hitting on you!
Mostly because I'm into dudes.
'Whoops. I guess I kind of misread that.
JNo sweat. I can tell you're the kind of girl who can stand up for herself.
You've got that right.
1Awesome. It sounds like we're going to get along.
9Well, one of my ex-boyfriends was a model, so... kind of?
3I'd say that makes you our resident fashion expert.
BPlease promise me that means we can go shopping together sometime.
Kaitlyn
 Ahhh! Only if I get to come too!
Sounds like fun.
So... do you have a girlfriend?
IOh wow. I'm going to take you hitting on me as a <i>major</i> compliment.
:But this is the part where I tell you that I'm into dudes.
'Whoops. I guess I kind of misread that.
UNo sweat. You're clearly the kind of girl who goes after what she wants. I like that.
:Thanks. I can already tell we're going to be best friends.
Hey! What about me?
'Don't worry. We can <i>all</i> be BFFs.
Yay!
Abbie
*I feel like we're still missing someone...
There he is!
XAt the far end of the roof, you spot a guy sitting by himself, looking out at the stars.
Tyler
...
PTyler! Enough with the shy nerd act! Get over here and talk to our new roommate!
EOh... hey there. I was just trying to see if I could spot Cassiopeia.
QThe constellations are just a little different here than back home in California.
IYou're into stargazing? I used to do that all the time when I was little.

Oh really?
{You}, sidebar.
Zack pulls you aside.
KOkay, just to fill you in, my boy Tyler has a massive insta-crush on Abbie.
[And I'm making it my mission in life to get those two crazy kids together. Are you with me?
(You want me to play matchmaker with you?
Consider this match MADE!
No way. I barely know them.
-Glad to have you on board. Let's get started.
fAs you head back to the group, Zack pretends to trip, and <i>accidentally</i> pushes Abbie into Tyler!
Relationship Improved
0Tyler and Abbie's relationship will be affected.
2I don't even know if they're right for each other!
SSince when has that ever stopped anyone? Do you even <i>watch</i> The Bachelorette?
TIt looks like I'm going to have to do this myself. Just try not to ruin this for me.
SAD
fAs you head back to the group, Zack pretends to trip, and <i>accidentally</i> pushes Abbie into Tyler!
7Tyler! I'm so sorry, I... er... thanks for catching me.
KAny time! Uh... I mean... any time you fall into me! Not... any other time!
<i>This could take a while.</i>
So... what now?
.I think this is supposed to be a party, right?
&Maybe we could start with some drinks?
PUh, {You}, I've got a bottle of wine down in my room. Want to help me go get it?
2Do we really need two people to grab a bottle of--
Just come on!

MUSIC_COLLEGE_ACTION_CHILL
BG_INT_DORM_MAIN_NIGHT
-Okay. Confess. You're into Chris, aren't you?
What? Me and Chris?
YI'm just trying to warn you... I'm pretty sure he mentioned something about a girlfriend.
&<shake_portrait/>What? You mean Becca?
5That bossy sorority girl we ran into at Welcome Week?
IYeah. When we first met, she was, like, Exorcist-level possessive of him.
ANGRY
INo, the girl Chris mentioned wasn't Becca. It was someone from back home.
Huh. Now I'm curious...
$I need to know if Chris is single...
For my sake!
Because I'm just that nosy!
(The truth is... I'm interested in Chris.
MWe're <i>living</i> with this guy! We have a right to know if he's available!
Makes sense to me.
8I'm pretty sure I know how to get him to spill his guts.
Oh yeah?
.Oh yeah. Watch and learn, my young apprentice.
#Aren't we pretty much the same age?
XDetails, details. If we play our cards right, you'll get to ask Chris anything you want.
YBack on the rooftop, Kaitlyn opens the bottle of wine and starts pouring it into glasses.
#She leans over and whispers to you.
<i>This is step one.</i>
Okay...
$Kaitlyn hands Chris a glass of wine.
(Heh. I'm more of a beer guy, but thanks.
Want a drink, {You}?
Wine?
I'm in!
I'm out!
A woman after my own heart!
FTyler and Zack pass out the glasses, and you all clink yours together.
4To an unforgettable freshman year. Cheers, everyone.
I'll drink to that!
 So responsible... I'm impressed.
Good. You should be.
XZack passes out the glasses, and Tyler pours you a cup of sparkling cider to toast with.
1To one hell of a freshman year! Cheers, everyone!
I'll drink to that!
So... what now?
YI'm glad you asked, Abbie... I think it's time for us to play some <i>Truth or Truth.</i>
What's that?
;It's Truth or Dare... except you <i>have</i> to pick truth.
5No dares? So no one's running naked through the quad?
=All in good time. We've got a whole year together, after all.
aFair point. Since it was your suggestion, why don't <i>you</i> answer the first 'truth,' Kaitlyn?
EOh, why don't we start with someone else? Like... Chris, for example?
-Nice try! Go ahead, {You}. Ask her something!
Okay, Kaitlyn...
Tell us about your first kiss!
%What's your most embarrassing secret?
1Ugh, you just <i>had</i> to go there, didn't you?
.You don't have to answer if you don't want to.
VNo, no. Rules are rules. My first kiss was in middle school with this guy named Aaron.
zWe were at a party, and we were all playing Seven Minutes in Heaven. And Aaron had <i>just</i> eaten a jalapeno on a dare.
Hot.
ìYeah. <i>Really</i> hot. When I came out of the closet, I was blushing, and <i>everyone</i> thought I liked him, but it was just the stupid pepper!
3I haven't gone near guys <i>or</i> jalapenos since.
2That's too bad... cause jalapenos are <i>bomb</i>.
'I'll take your word for it. Who's next?
1Ugh, you just <i>had</i> to go there, didn't you?
.You don't have to answer if you don't want to.
ëNo, no. Rules are rules. My most embarrassing secret... is probably the fact that you can <i>still</i> access my MySpace site from middle school.
gI forgot my login info, so my awkward goth phase is still on the internet for the whole world to see...
&Oh my god. You <i>have</i> to show us!
Noooo way. Not happening.
IBesides... you guys couldn't handle <i>xXSorrowfulRaven95Xx</i>'s poetry.
Poetry?!
<Searching that username now, and... oh god. This is amazing.
êYou all crowd around Tyler's phone screen to see middle-school Kaitlyn in tattered fishnets and combat boots, pouting through smeared eyeshadow.
#No no no! <i>Please</i> don't look!
{Favorite band: <i>Evanescence?</i> Latest status: 'We are all the masks we wear. And mine is weeping.' This is <i>gold.</i>
Oh, poor Kaitlyn!
,Hey, if you need to cry, we're here for you.
$Very funny. Let's move on, shall we?
kSoon, it's Zack's turn to ask a question. He puts on an exaggerated thinking face and scratches his chin...
"Hmmmm, what to ask, what to ask...
>Got it! I want someone to tell me their <i>ultimate fancy!</i>
;Sorry, ultimate <i>fantasy</i>... this is some strong wine!
Or you're a total lightweight.
^Says the girl who's gone from sitting on the couch to lying on the ground after two glasses...
 What? It's <i>comfortable</i>...
<So, Zack, whose 'ultimate fancy' did you want to hear about?
BYou know what... I already forgot! Who <i>should</i> I ask, {You}?
Who should Zack ask?
Zack
Tyler
Abbie
Chris
Kaitlyn
1Okay, Zack. I want to know your ultimate fantasy.
 What? You want me to ask myself?
Yep.
#Wow. Okay. This could take a while.
SThe year is 1959, and Handsome Zack is the most feared gangster on the West Side...
Oh god. Where is this going?
í...our two gangs meet on E Street, a lone traffic light blazing overhead. I pull out my switchblade, and Big Jim puts on a pair of brass knuckles.
ZThere's gonna be a rumble, but the hardest fight is keeping our forbidden love a secret...
EAs the story finally comes to a conclusion, Kaitlyn dabs at her eyes.
vAnd as the light leaves Big Jim's eyes, I lean down to whisper, 'Wherever you're going, my love... wait for me there.'
$Wow. That was... kind of incredible.
Obviously. What did you expect?
2Okay, Tyler. I want to know your ultimate fantasy.
?That's easy! <i>The Black Cauldron.</i> Best fantasy book ever!

That's not what I meant...
9Huh? Oh! Hey, technically I answered your question, so...
 Oh, fine. Let's just move along.
2Okay, Abbie. I want to know your ultimate fantasy.
,I... uh... wow, do I absolutely have to say?
Those are the rules!
Okay, uh... let me think...
vI guess it'd be nice to have someone to, you know, spend a quiet evening with... maybe cuddled up with some hot cocoa?
'Wow, Abbie. That was <i>scandalous</i>.
Hey, you guys wanted to know!
2Okay, Chris. I want to know your ultimate fantasy.
$Wow. Let's see. Nothing too crazy...
?Like, I'm a fireman, and I save a girl from a burning building.
8And then she's really... grateful. You know what I mean.
1Oh yeah, we <i>definitely</i> know what you mean.
UInteresting... I guess we should be careful not to leave any candles burning up here.
0...or maybe we <i>should</i> leave them burning.
 That part is up to you, I guess.
4Okay, Kaitlyn. I want to know your ultimate fantasy.
"I guess I'm a romantic at heart...
\Maybe something with soft white sand, and waves lapping at our feet as we kiss on the beach.
This is getting good.
TOh! And we need a bottle of champagne and a plate of chocolate-covered strawberries.
7Scratch that. <i>I</i> want to be covered in chocolate.
+Not bad, Kaitlyn. I like the way you think.
NThe game continues as you wait for your opportunity to ask Chris a question...
>Ugh, don't freak out, but... I've never actually kissed a guy.
5Wait, not even <i>one</i>? I've kissed, like, twenty!
On the same day?
Very funny, Tyler.
5Although... three of them were on the same day, yeah.
,...and the best part is? I never got caught.
9Okay, you're officially the coolest person I've ever met!
!Who skinny-dips in a public pool?
Heroes, {You}. <i>Heroes</i>.
#Okay, Tyler... I dare you to kiss--
5You can't dare me to kiss anyone. There are no dares!
Oh yeah, I forgot...

MUSIC_COLLEGE_TENSE_ACTION
Until finally...
6Looks like it's your turn to ask me a question, {You}.
EKaitlyn leans over to whisper to you while you think of a question...
(Try not to be <i>too</i> obvious, {You}.
Chris...
0What's the weirdest place you've ever hooked up?
Have you ever been in love?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Ooh, <i>nice!</i>
$The weirdest place I hooked up, huh?
My girlfriend - well, <i>ex</i>-girlfriend - set up a romantic picnic for our two-year anniversary right on the football field.
-The sun set, one thing led to another, and...
\We got chased off by the cops, and I lost my favorite shirt. Still... those were good times.
2Dang, {You} going straight for the serious topics!
QIt's okay. Yeah... I was in love, once. Throughout most of high school, actually.
7So you dated the same girl through all of high school?!
OBasically. Hurt pretty bad when she broke it off, but... those were good times.
Not anymore...
&Kind of hurts to admit that, actually.
'Kaitlyn shoots you an exasperated look.
-Uh... sorry to bring up something so painful.
BBut since you're already talking about it... want to tell us more?
>I guess. I dated the same girl throughout most of high school.
*Sounds like she was pretty special to you.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_LOVE_SAD
.She was. I wasn't going to go into this, but..
BMy ex's name is Nicole... and she's the first person I ever loved.
kWe were together for three years. But when she decided to go to another college, she dumped me on the spot.
That's so... harsh.
RTo be honest... I'm still not over her. And it'll probably be a while before I am.
pThat's why I promised myself that I'm just going to have fun here. No serious relationships for at least a year!
Huh...
That's smart.
That's idiotic.
!You've got to protect yourself...
SAnd it wouldn't be fair to the next girl you date if you're still not over your ex.
Exactly.
$How can you make such a stupid rule?
VWhat if you miss out on the love of your life because you don't want to get 'serious?'
iWell... I kind of assume the love of my life would be willing to wait a year for me to figure things out.
&You just keep telling yourself that...
>Listen, enough about me. Can I ask {You} a question in return?
What do the rules say, Kaitlyn?
GSo far it seems like the rules are whatever Kaitlyn wants them to be...
Ask away, Chris!
(Okay, {You}... what's your take on love?
My take on love?
(I'm open to love, but I'm not desperate.
I fall in love way too easily.
!Love is just a chemical reaction.
'Seems wise. Best to just let it happen.
Exactly.
)Better than never falling in love, right?
9Maybe. Sometimes I wonder if it's worth the pain, though.
OI think it is. Besides... with the right person, it doesn't have to be painful.
,I guess I'll find out when the time comes...
AIs anyone else shivering? Cause that was <pause/><i>ice cold.</i>
Hey, she's not wrong...
iStill... even if you believe love is purely chemical, it still affects you the same. It still feels real.
2Hmm... I guess I hadn't thought about it that way.
'Interesting... <i>very</i> interesting.
WA few rounds of drinks and questions later, Abbie looks at her phone to check the time.
WWell, I've hit my embarrassment quota for the night, so I think I'm going to turn in...
What? It's so early!

It's two in the morning...
Exactly!
bHonestly... I am a little tired. But I just want to say this is the most fun I've <i>ever</i> had.
Me too.
LIt's going to be an amazing year. I'm so glad I have you guys as suitemates.
.And on that note, I'll see you in the morning.
sI actually think I'll head to bed, too. Besides... we've got plenty of nights like these to look forward to, right?
I guess you're right.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_LOVE
]As Kaitlyn and the others leave the roof, she shoots you and Chris one last, meaningful look.
...
What was that look all about?
1Uh, nothing! Just... one of those looks, I guess!
AYou gaze out over the starlit campus, shivering in the night air.
So... not tired?
QNot yet. And I want to savor this, you know? Our first night together as a suite.
 It all starts here. You nervous?
A little. You?
Oh, I'm <i>terrified.</i>
lBut it's a good kind of terrified. And so long as you're around... I'd say there's a lot to look forward to.
Chris...
I feel exactly the same way.
)You must think you're pretty smooth, huh?
ÑI know we just met, but... I feel a connection with you. And maybe it's not cool to say that, but I just had to get it off my chest.
I'm glad you did.
Really?
Really.
Not at all!
zI've dated exactly one girl, {You}. Unless you're counting the time I picked a flower for a girl in my kindergarten class.
+I'm the exact opposite of smooth, trust me.
Well... you could've fooled me.
Really?
2Really. But don't let it go to your head, big guy.
vListen... I know I must be throwing out mixed signals. The truth is, I'm really not looking to start anything serious.
@But... here, in this moment with you. Things just feel... right.
JChris moves to sit closer to you and takes your hand, cautiously at first.
...
VWhen you don't pull away, he interlaces his fingers with yours and smiles down at you.
Chris...
Let's go to my room.
chris_hookup
Hold me.
%I think it's time we call it a night.
Relationship Improved
.Your relationship with Chris will be affected.
I was hoping you'd say that.
nThe two of you walk back downstairs from the roof, hand in hand, stealing glances at each other all the while.
BG_INT_DORM_BEDROOM_NIGHT
SSo, this is my room... you might recognize it from your similar room down the hall.
'I like what you've done with the place.
(Yeah, I have a lot of unpacking to do...
But all that can wait.
You pull Chris close and tilt your mouth up to his. Your lips meet as you melt into him, and soon you're pulling his shirt up over his head.
You5
ChrisShirtless
Someone's in a hurry...
pYou push Chris back onto your bed and climb on top of him, kissing your way up his stomach to his stubbled chin.
$Oh, I'm just getting <i>started.</i>

XWithout another word, Chris rolls over on top of you, pulling off your shirt as he goes.

Nice move.

I thought you'd like that.
$Soon, he's kissing you everywhere...
Chris...
Don't you dare stop now.
We should slow down.
Whatever you say...
<i>Oh, Chris...</i>
Soon, the night melts away...
!Of course. I'll follow your lead.
7Just hold me... and we'll see where the night takes us.
0I'll hold you all night if that's what you want.
%Well, that's not <i>all</i> I want...
;As you lie happily in Chris's arms, the night melts away...
Fast Mover!
You hooked up with Chris!
ëLater, you and Chris lay beside each other, your faces nearly touching on the pillow. He stifles a laugh, his blue eyes crinkling at the corners.
What are you laughing at?
=I'm not laughing, I just... I don't know. I'm happy, I guess.
Me too. This was... nice.
It really was.
You smile and look down shyly, your finger tracing figure-eights on Chris's upper arm, your legs tangled up beneath the sheets.
*Well... I guess I'll head back to my room.
.Unless... you want me to stay a little longer?
I don't know... do you want to?
Yeah. I do.
Good answer.

Relationship Improved
.Your relationship with Chris will be affected.
Come here...
7Chris wraps his arms around you, and you lean into him.
"You know, this does feel... right.
YYou tilt your mouth up to meet his, your lips melting together as Chris pulls you closer.
[When you finally break away, Chris stifles a laugh, his blue eyes crinkling at the corners.
"What the hell are you laughing at?
=I'm not laughing, I just... I don't know. I'm happy, I guess.
Me too. That was nice.
TYou smile and look down shyly, your finger tracing figure-eights on Chris's forearm.
,Well... I guess it's time we got some sleep.
!Yeah... it's getting pretty late.
-Maybe we can talk more later? Or, you know...
 I'd like that. Goodnight, Chris.
Night, {You}.
Relationship Damaged
.Your relationship with Chris will be affected.
%Oh... yeah, I guess it is a bit late.
-Sorry if I was coming on a little too strong.
3That's not it. It's just been a long day, you know?
EAnd as nice as this is... a girl's gotta get some sleep now and then.
Gotcha.
Maybe we can talk more later?
;Seems unavoidable. We do live in the same suite, after all.

Right. How could I forget?
Goodnight, Chris.
Night, {You}.
BG_INT_DORM_BEDROOM_DAY
/You wake up to the sound of your phone ringing.
Ugh... what time is it?
FYou grope in the sheets for your phone and find it beside your pillow.
/Four missed calls? From my parents? What the...
BG_EXT_CAMPUS_QUAD_DAY
PYou walk down the hall and step out into the chill morning air to take the call.
AMom? What's going on? Why did you guys call me <i>four times?</i>

Mom
.{You}, there's something I have to tell you...
#Did something happen? What's wrong?

CIt's your father. He... he lost his job. We can't pay your tuition!
.But... but I haven't even started classes yet!
Mom...
'Don't worry. I'll figure something out.
This is so unfair!
,We're so, <i>so</i> sorry about this, {You}.
YWe're going to make this right, okay? Your father just needs some time to find a new job.
We love you!
