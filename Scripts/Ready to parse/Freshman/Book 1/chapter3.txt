You
\After you get off the phone with your parents, you meet up with your friends in the kitchen.
Kaitlyn

{You}? Is everything okay?
SAD
*I... I don't think so. My family is broke.
JWhat started off as the best week of my life just turned into a nightmare.
Zack
/We can't lose you! We've... we've <i>bonded!<i>
+I guess there's only one thing to do now...
I have to...
NEUTRAL
Enjoy the time I have left.
Find a way to stay.

Who's ready to party?
HAPPY
Tyler
4Not me. I'm still feeling the effects of last night.
DDon't listen to this wet blanket, {You}. Let's do this thing. Shots!
Abbie
DAre you kidding me? We're <i>not</i> drinking at ten in the morning.
	SURPRISED
Chris
8And I'm <i>not</i> letting {You} just give up and leave!
MUSIC_COLLEGE_ACTION_FUN
#I'm not going down without a fight!
Hell yeah! That's the spirit!
Maybe you could get... a job?
XNo offense, but tuition runs like $50k a year here. Minimum wage isn't gonna cover that.
UThere's gotta be some way you can stay... I mean, I'm here on a football scholarship.
@I don't think I'm exactly what the football team is looking for.
?Maybe not, but I'm sure there are other scholarships available.
\Not a bad idea, Chris. It might be worth a trip to the financial aid office to check it out!

A few minutes later...
Twombly
Next!
KHi there! My friend just realized she's super poor and needs a scholarship!
Kaitlyn!
eWhat? It's true. Besides, if we're trying to get this done fast, we've got to cut right to the chase.
%Let's see here... any special skills?
Actually...
I'm a star athlete!
I'm a scholar!
I'm not special at all...
 Really?! What sport do you play?
All of 'em.
-You're gonna have to be more specific, honey.
ÇOh, well in high school I played basketball, soccer, and volleyball. And softball. Also, I started an intramural dodgeball league.
I guess you weren't kidding.
*I had no idea you were such a jock, {You}.
^Unfortunately... it looks like all of our athletic scholarships have already been distributed.
*I was the valedictorian at my high school!
4What? How come you never told me you're a huge nerd?
BJust because I happen to get great grades doesn't mean I'm a nerd!
ANGRY
]Whether you're a nerd or not, all of our academic scholarships have already been distributed.
Well, at least you're honest...
+But we don't give scholarships for honesty.
"Aw, {You}! I think you're special.
+Hey, at least you have good friends, right?
FYeah... I can't wait to watch them all have fun at college without me.
pSorry, honey, but I can't just give you a scholarship out of the kindness of my heart. It doesn't work that way.
!There has to be <i>something.</i>
HWell... there is... one thing. But I'm not quite sure you'd be up to it.
"Thanks for the vote of confidence!
ZIt's nothing personal. It's just, well... we do have one research assistant position open.
3It would pay for your tuition, plus room and board.
"But... it's for Professor Vasquez.
tProfessor Enrique Vasquez?! The famous author? <i>The Names of All Lost Things</i> is one of my favorite books ever!
!Working for him would be amazing!
.Spoken like someone who's never met the man...
pProfessor Vasquez has taken on over a dozen assistants in the last five years. None has lasted more than a week.
Until now...
That's what they all say...
The thing about me is...
I'm special.
I'm desperate.
lBelieve me, honey... the real world doesn't care how special you are. And Professor Vasquez certainly won't.
$Is that supposed to be a good thing?

Uh... yes?
If you say so...

Good luck. You'll need it.

A few minutes later...

I think this is the place.
!Time to make my first impression.
James
Hello?
????
KYou! You're that guy I saw across the quad the first day. I... er.. wait...

Are you...
Professor Vasquez?

A student?
Single?
 Guilty as charged. And you are--
????
<Your new assistant, {You}! Anything you want, I'm your girl!
1Great... because I could really use an Americano.
????
 Sure thing! I'm at your service.
HPerfect. There's a little shop downtown that <i>really</i> knows their--
????
=Guilty as charged. I'm Vasquez's... well, protege, I suppose.
????
fHe helps me with the play I'm writing, I help him with odds and ends while he's... between assistants.
????
RFor a second, I thought you might mistake me for the professor. What gave me away?
????
+The fact that you're not seventy years old.
;Hey, I could just be an old guy that looks good for my age.
????
I never said you looked good.
So you don't think I--
????
3Actually, I'm in a pretty committed relationship...
????
;...with my work. The play I'm writing is basically my life.
????
9So I guess that doesn't leave much room for a girlfriend.
Relationship Improved
.Your relationship with James will be affected.
6Well, even Shakespeare took a break from time to time.
????
FYour conversation is interrupted as a voice shouts from down the hall.
Q<i>James! I've lost my latest pages again! Get in here and help me find them!</i>
Voice
I'd better get on that.
Wait. So you're not Vasquez?
OLooks like you caught me. Too bad. I was really looking forward to that coffee.
4If you're not Vasquez, then what are you doing here?
ÜProfessor Vasquez is my mentor. He helps me with the play I'm writing, I help him with odds and ends while he's... between assistants.
I'll let him know you're here.
HHere's hoping you stick around. I'll let the professor know you're here.
As James leaves, a notebook falls from his backpack onto the floor. Kaitlyn surreptitiously snatches it up and reads the cover.
3Looks like someone dropped the script for his play!
6Should we run after him? I'm sure he'd want it back...
4Yeah, but if we did that, we'd never get to read it!
(Kaitlyn eagerly flips through the pages.
qBlah blah, class disparity, blah blah, working conditions in Victorian London... oh <i>here's</i> something good!
@Kaitlyn! I'm not sure James would want you looking through that.
FThis is getting juicy. Apparently James has a... creative imagination.
What are you talking about?
CI'm not sure I should show you... it might warp your innocent mind.
Kaitlyn!
3This is hot stuff. Tell you what. One time offer...
8You and I can do a little line reading? What do you say?

Come on...
Let's read that scene!
	read_play
Don't read it.
	read_play
*Just then, you hear footsteps approaching.
Vasquez
+Who is making all of this racket out here?!
.Sounds like my cue to leave! Good luck, {You}!
"An older man storms into the room.
0You! Are <i>you</i> the one disturbing my peace?
Aw. You're no fun.
BAnyway, I should probably get going. Good luck with Vasquez, okay?
?As Kaitlyn leaves, you hear the sound of footsteps approaching.
+Who is making all of this racket out here?!
3James follows the professor as he storms up to you.
%We... we were practically whispering.
;Professor, allow me to introduce your new assistant. {You}.
KAssistant. What a joke. Have you ever <i>assisted</i> anyone before, {You}?
GI mean... not professionally. But I like to think of myself as helpful.
0My last assistant thought she was being helpful.
dRight up until the moment she 'helpfully' lost a flash drive containing three months' worth of work!
tAnd then there was the assistant before her. <i>He</i> thought it would be helpful to hum while he dusted my office.
gThat cacophonous melody was rattling around my head for weeks! I couldn't write a word on my new novel!
XAnd then there was the last guy. He had a distracting sense of fashion! So many stripes!
How... terrible for you.
XTerrible is an understatement. Do you think Faulkner had to deal with such distractions?
A<i>His</i> family afforded him the peace and quiet of their barn!
7He got quiet solitude. All I get are <i>assistants.</i>
:I understand... but I won't be like your other assistants.
And why exactly is that?
I'm different because...
I'm a fast learner!
I'm willing to do anything!
I'll actually stand up to you!
?Everyone makes mistakes... but I never make the same one twice!
'Weren't you listening to a word I said?
>Around here, one mistake is grounds for immediate termination!
CI already assumed that was a prerequisite! Extremely disappointing.
.I don't take crap from anyone. Especially you.
AObeying my every command is basically the entire job description!
Get out!
MYou turn and take a step toward the door. Then you stop and look back at him.
No.
No?
#I won't get out. I'm going to stay.
JYesterday was incredible. I made friends faster than I ever have before...
chris_hookup
(I may have even met the love of my life.
ZI... I can't just walk away from this. I know in my heart that this is where I need to be.
6And I'm not going to let some angry old man ruin that!
)Listen to you. Reactive. Angry. Entitled.
?<shake_portrait/>You're a caricature of your entire generation!
IAs he says the words, Professor Vasquez stops for a moment... and then...
FWhich actually makes you exactly the person I'm looking for after all.
<shake_portrait/>What?
I'll explain later.
achievement_enrolled
PFor now, I'll accept you as my assistant on a trial basis. Starting immediately.
kIn fact, I have a pressing matter that I need you to take care of tonight. Let's call it your first test...
Anything! I'm on it!
MVasquez walks over to his bookshelf and pulls out a massive, dusty old novel.
_This is my second novel, <i>A Winter in July.</i> It needs to be digitized by tomorrow morning.
$No problem! I'll scan it right away!
]Actually... no. I need it formatted as a text document. You'll have to transcribe it by hand.
&But... but it's like a thousand pages!
)In that case... you'd better get to work.
,Let's see... <i>Rosethorne Park.</i> Act IV.
rLooks like you'll be Lady Elizabeth Darling, and I'll be William, the stableboy turned soldier, back from the war.
8Hey! Why do you get to be the cool, brooding heartthrob?
.I think that's obvious. Now let's get started.
O<i>Lady Elizabeth Darling wakes up to find her bedroom bathed in moonlight.</i>
A<i>Then, as she watches, a shadow appears at the open window.</i>
Your line, {You}.
=<i>Be warned, intruder! I keep a knife beneath my pillow.</i>
I<i>Careful, then. I'd hate to die before tasting your lips once more.</i>
0<i>The figure enters the room. It's William.</i>
)<i>You... you know you can't be here.</i>
i<i>William pulls off his shirt and tosses it to the floor, his eyes on the knife in Elizabeth's hand.</i>
n<i>If you mean to stab me, do me the courtesy of giving me a quick death. I can't live without you anyway.</i>
s<i>Elizabeth lowers the dagger from his chest to his trousers... then cuts through his belt in a single stroke!</i>
HOh wow. I can't believe James wrote this. He seems so... straight-laced.
%Sometimes people will surprise you...
D<i>Elizabeth reaches forward and gently strokes William's cheek.</i>
AUh, are we following stage directions too, or just reading aloud?
I leave that up to you.
(What do you do?)
Stroke Kaitlyn's cheek.
Keep your hands to yourself.
KYou brush Kaitlyn's cheek with the backs of your fingers, making her blush.
Relationship Improved
0Your relationship with Kaitlyn will be affected.
Oh, {You}...
#Uh, I mean... <i>oh, Elizabeth!</i>
MShe places a hand on your waist and pulls you close, gazing into your eyes...
:<i>You have no idea how long I've awaited this moment.</i>
8<i>Sometimes the waiting makes it all the sweeter...</i>
_You place your hand on Kaitlyn's chest and feel her heartbeat against the tips of your fingers.
{You}... I...
&Let's just stick to the reading, okay?

Of course.
F<i>My lady, I am entirely at your mercy. Do with me what you will.</i>
\<i>I suppose I can find a use for you... you can start by helping me out of this corset.</i>
£<i>Elizabeth turns her back to William, tucking her long, plaited hair over her shoulder. He kneels behind her, his fingers going to the laces of her corset...</i>
/<i>Not like that... with your <i>mouth</i>.</i>
(Oh, wow, I did <i>not</i> expect that...
/Seriously... is it getting hot in here or what?
A-hem.
%I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
We were just--
;Enjoying my play? Or at least, I hope you were enjoying it.
Actually...

I can't wait to read more.
I've read better.
Want to join in the 'reading?'
Relationship Improved
.Your relationship with James will be affected.
GThat's nice to hear. I still don't quite know how to finish that scene.
I have a couple of ideas.
I bet you do.
HBut just so you know, the Victorian era was all about unrequited love...
!And <i>unconsummated</i> romance.
BWell... there's no reason your play can't be the exception, right?
I guess we'll see.
AI thought the Victorian era was all about unconsummated desire...
JWell, I don't want to be completely slavish to the conventions of the era.
^But you may have a point. Perhaps the lovers should be interrupted before things go too far...
Ouch. What a sad story.
&It <i>is</i> supposed to be a tragedy.
9It seems like the two of you have it pretty well covered.
The more the merrier.
Relationship Improved
.Your relationship with James will be affected.
3It's okay. I've always preferred two-person scenes.
<But I'm glad the two of you were able to appreciate my work.
7It seemed like you <i>really</i> inhabited those roles.
'Oh yeah. I hate to do anything halfway.
There's our roomie!
1I heard from Kaitlyn that you got a research job!
4Let's celebrate! The roof garden is calling my name!
%Guys... there's nothing to celebrate.
OVasquez is crazy. He wants me to transcribe his thousand-page novel... tonight.
TEven if I work all night, I'll only be able to pound out a couple hundred pages max.
lTyping at a hundred words a minute for eight hours, assuming 250 words per page... you'd generate 192 pages.
,Wow. Did you just do that math in your head?
Uh... is that weird?
Weird?
No way! Smart is sexy.
'Try bleak. I'll never finish this task!
Matchmaker!
(Abbie and Tyler's relationship improved!
tyler_abbie
Really?
Totally.
Wow, uh... thanks!
<Abbie smiles shyly at Tyler as you wink at Kaitlyn and Zack.
;So... back to the matter at hand. What do you think, Tyler?
,This book is just too long! It's impossible!
WAccording to my calculations, one person typing alone can write 192 pages in 8 hours...
hBut if all <i>six</i> of us do this together... we'll have more than enough time to write the full book!
Go team! Let's do this thing!
JYou... you'd really stay up all night helping me with this stupid project?
SIt does mean I'll have to miss several fabulous frat parties tonight... but I'm in.
Eh. I didn't have plans anyway.
 You belong here, {You}. With us.
7I'll start a pot of coffee. It's gonna be a long night!
Let's write some pages!"
