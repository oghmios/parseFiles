Chapter Five: Game Day
The Freshman
You
BG_INT_LECTURE_HALL
KA few days later, you're just getting out of a lecture with Zack and Tyler.
Atiyah
H...I'll expect those problem sets completed and emailed to me by Friday.
Zack
3Ugh. Who knew college was going to be so much work?
SAD
Tyler
0Are you kidding me? I can't wait to get started!
HAPPY
LMaybe we could form a little study group! That would make the work more fun!
<jiggle>Study buddies!<jiggle>
3I wish I hadn't just said that so enthusiastically.
EHave I ever told you how adorably nerdy you are? Study buddies it is.
BG_EXT_CAMPUS_QUAD_DAY
KAs you exit the lecture hall, you see Abbie walking back toward your suite.
Abbie
...
BI'm, uh... gonna go catch up to her. Talk to you guys later, okay?
	SURPRISED
Tyler runs off.
1Aw. He's like a puppy in love with another puppy.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_COMEDY_MISCHIEF
7Speaking of which... how are things with you and Chris?
,I... I don't know what you're talking about.

Oh really?
Zack...
NEUTRAL
I'll tell you everything!
Nothing happened.
chris_hookup
(Okay... so we kind of... slept together!
Wow! You work fast!
NI figured it would take at least a week for you two to end up in bed together!
Not so loud!
 Okay... so we kind of... kissed.
Wow! You work fast!
HI figured it would take at least a week for you two to start hooking up!

I said it was just a kiss!
5Chris tried to kiss me... and I kind of rejected him.
Ouch. That is awkward.
Thanks for the support!
There's nothing to tell.
2Oh, please. I already know that you two hooked up!
Not so loud!
1Oh, please. I already know that you two made out!
Not so loud!
4Oh, please. I already know that you broke his heart!
Not so loud!
}The worst part is, I <i>have</i> to talk to Chris for Professor Vasquez's assignment. And it's going to be <i>so</i> awkward.
Oh, don't be such a baby.
6I'm sure he'll be eager to see you! <i>Very</i> eager.
Zack...
%Fine. I'll stop teasing you. For now.
IBut just be honest with me for a sec. How <i>do</i> you feel about Chris?
Chris?
I... have feelings for him.
He's just a friend.
He means nothing to me.
UI knew it! In that case, you should be <i>happy</i> to have an excuse to talk to him!
SWell, if he's your <i>friend,</i> then talking to him should be no big deal, right?
-Yikes. Remind me not to get on your bad side.
YBut I guess if that's how you really feel, talking to Chris should be no big deal, right?
I guess you have a point...
OOf course, I do. It's best to learn this about me now: I'm <i>always</i> right.
7Now come on! Chris should be in the middle of practice.
]You can watch him in action and then ask him a few questions about life as a football player.
AAnd in the meantime I can make sure you don't embarrass yourself!
How thoughtful of you...

aA few minutes later, you arrive at the stadium and find the team on the green, practicing drills.
=Oh wow... look at Captain America over there by the sideline.

Darren
DarrenFootball
...
ZWait... I recognize that face. It's Darren Taylor! He's our school's starting quarterback!
$I thought Chris was our quarterback.
KIs that what he told you? Chris is only a freshman. He's our <i>backup.</i>
ZI don't see Chris around... maybe I should ask Darren a few questions about football life.
TYou walk up to Darren and find him chatting with a pair of all-too familiar girls...
Becca
What are you doing here?
ANGRY
Breathing? Existing?
_Well, go exist somewhere else. Madison and I are having a <i>deep</i> conversation with Darren!
Madison
=He was just telling us about how to handle getting tackled...
OMaybe you could show me your technique later, Darren! I'm <i>super</i> curious.
@It's all about squaring your hips and getting low to the ground.
Sounds like fun!
XActually... I was sort of hoping I could ask Darren a question. For a project, you know?
'Go right ahead, new girl. Don't be shy.
I want to ask...
How's the team's chemistry?
*Is it hard to balance football and school?

Do you get a lot of girls?
,I love the team. These guys are my brothers.
;It's a good energy this year. Everyone just seems... happy.
fIt's not easy! I always try to take a lighter load during fall quarter since I'm so busy playing ball.
6And I'm not gonna lie. Football life has its... perks.
HI know this life won't last forever. I want to enjoy myself while I can.
Wow, rude much?
;Let's just say I'm not hurting for attention. Life is good.
:Not <i>everyone</i> on the team seems so happy-go-lucky...

Chris
ChrisFootball
nZack gestures toward a bench at the far end of the field, where Chris is sitting by himself, hanging his head.
...
*I'll go talk to him... see how he's doing.
Good luck. He's super moody.
5He wouldn't even talk to <i>me.</i> And I'm <i>me!<i>
0You walk away from the group and approach Chris.
...
Hey there... you doing okay?

Oh! {You}!
4I'm solid. Just a little winded from all the drills.
Really?
-Aren't you bummed about being a bench-warmer?
Are you sad about... us?
You can see right through me.
6Us? I mean... I <i>have</i> been thinking about you...
/But I'm worried about something else right now.
qIt's just... I <i>knew</i> I'd be on the bench behind Darren, but I wasn't really prepared for the reality of it.
RI can't stand the idea of not being able to help my teammates get a win, you know?
:All through high school, I <i>lived</i> for Friday nights.
aThat rush of adrenaline as our team sprinted out onto the field... nothing else even comes close.
(What should I do?)
Flirt.
Keep listening.
OYou're sure <i>nothing</i> else comes close to the feeling of playing football?
*Well... I guess there is <i>one</i> thing.
!He reaches out to take your hand.
;I just feel like... if I'm not on the field, then who am I?
You're <i>Chris!</i>
I guess I am.
!He reaches out to take your hand.
(What should I do?)

Step back.
Hold his hand.

I... uh...
Sorry. Ugh. What a day...
Relationship Improved
.Your relationship with Chris will be affected.
$Chris squeezes your hand and smiles.
9You know... I think I'm starting to feel a little better.

Logan
LoganFootball
:Chris! Coach is asking for you. Ready to get in some reps?
(Looks like I'm up. See you later, {You}.
 Sure thing! Good luck out there!
Zack walks up to you.
So... how's our golden boy?
"Feeling less than golden, I think.
QSounds like it's up to us to cheer him up. Don't worry. We'll think of something.
BG_INT_DORM_MAIN_NIGHT
jLater that week, the night before the big game, you sit at the table in the kitchen to do some studying...
3This problem set is actually harder than I thought!
5That's why you need... <jiggle>Study Buddies!<jiggle>
9You're never going to let me forget saying that, are you?
LAs the three of you study, Abbie walks past you, headed for the living room.
wI'll be sitting in front of my laptop waiting for the new episode of <i>The Crown and the Flame</i> if anyone needs me.
...
$So, Tyler. What are you waiting for?
What are you talking about?
1You and Abbie! When are you going to ask her out?
=Ask her out? No way. I'd just embarrass myself. Right, {You}?
KMaybe you should go talk to her, {You}. You've got the female connection...
fSpend some time with Abbie, talk to her about Tyler, and I <i>know</i> you can help get them together!
Tyler...
Let me talk to Abbie...
abbie_homesick
I can't help you.
'I can't ask Abbie out for you, Tyler...
*If you want her, go do something about it.
This is way too much pressure!
)No one ever said relationships were easy.
CA while later, you come back to find Tyler and Zack still studying.
'See you guys later. I'll be in my room.
,As soon as she's gone, you turn to the guys.
<Okay... so Abbie and I just had an interesting conversation.
Tell. Us. Everything.
Ten minutes later...
Wow... that's a lot to process.

Wing Woman
+You gathered girl intel on Abbie for Tyler.
?But at least it sounds like I might have a shot! Thanks, {You}!
(So... when are you going to ask her out?
GTell you what. I promise I'll make a move... by the end of the quarter.
%Interesting. How's this for a deal...
=You ask out Abbie... and I'll promise to ask out Brandon too.
1I'm pretty sure you were going to do that anyway.
Guilty as charged!
%See? Flirting is <i>easy</i> for you.
Flirting is <i>never</i> easy.
TTell you what. We'll make a pact. By the end of the quarter, we'll both make a move.
+What about you, {You}? Want in on the deal?
Guys...
I promise to go out with Chris!
 I promise to ask out... someone.
I promise to stay single!
VBetween you and Chris and Tyler and Abbie, this suite is gonna be a full on love nest!
It's a pact!
'Keeping your options open... I like it.
It's a pact!
But... the pact!
;Aw, who cares. She's single and ready to mingle! I love it!
BG_INT_DORM_MAIN_DAY
NOn the day of Chris's first game, you bump into him as he's leaving the suite.
Hey, {You}.
Ready for the big game?
.Yeah... ready to keep the bench nice and warm.
&As he leaves, Kaitlyn walks up to you.
Kaitlyn
JLooks like someone's got his shoulder pads in a twist. What's up with him?
AI think he just needs a boost... he's not used to playing backup.
(Then let's remind him how awesome he is!
?Assemble the housemates! It's time to launch Operation Fanclub!
ZWe're going to need five posterboards, a ten-pack of colored markers, and some body paint!
What are you planning?
You'll see!
BG_EXT_FOOTBALL_FIELD_NIGHT
!A few hours later, at the game...
Go <i>Chris!</i>
6You hold up a sign reading <i>Chris is Number One!</i>
?I can't believe you convinced me to paint an 'R' on my stomach.
MI hear you. I want it noted that I'm <i>only</i> doing this for Chris's sake.
EAs the team runs out onto the field, you spot Chris near the front...
$Here he comes! Shirts off, everyone!
(What should I do?)
Take my shirt off!
Keep my shirt on.
Number 1 Fan!
)You supported Chris at the football game.

OUTFIT
&PORTRAIT_CUSTOM_OUTFIT_UNDERWEAR_BLACK
UYou all take off your shirts to reveal <i>C-H-R-I-S</i> painted across your stomachs!
Woo hoo! Go Chris!

Oh... wow.
Thanks guys.
2Your friends take off their shirts, but you don't!
+'CRIS'? That's not how you spell my name...
KaitlynUnderwear
:{You}! What's your problem! You're supposed to be our 'H'!
%Sorry, guys. What can I say? I'm shy!
5The game begins, and Chris takes a seat on the bench.
Looking good, Knights!
We love you, Darren!
Darren runs out on the field...
Go <red>Knights!</red>
/After the kickoff, the offense takes the field.
Omaha! Fifty-two black!
+In the first quarter, the Knights dominate!
Check out my endzone dance!
2But they seem to lose focus in the second quarter.

Another fumble? Seriously?
Come on, Knights...
Do the thing with the ball!
*Halftime finds the score knotted at 21-21.
&Who knew sports would be so stressful?
PAs the game winds to a close, you're down 24-21 with only a minute left to play!
4Let's do this, Knights! We can still win this thing!
,Darren drops back, looking for an opening...
Holy crap! They're blitzing!
LThe opposing team rushes Darren in a sudden charge! He takes a vicious sack!

<shake_portrait/>My ankle!
BI definitely heard something snap... I think I'm going to be sick.
How is that even <i>legal</i>?
@As you watch in stunned silence, Darren is carted off the field.
Oh no...
*Poor Darren... I hope he gets better soon.
6In the meantime, we've got a few seconds left to play.
*It's next man up... and that man is Chris!
1Chris runs onto the field, taking Darren's place.
,Come on, guys! Let's get the crowd fired up!
Go...
Kings!
Queens!
Knights!
Go Knights!
Yeah!
!And go... <jiggle>Chris!</jiggle>
/You shout Chris's name, and the crowd joins in.
"Okay... let's do this. For Darren!
1Uh... excuse you. Our team is the <i>Knights!</i>
PThe crowd around you murmurs. Chris looks hesitant as he talks to his teammates.
...
/I hope I didn't just mess up his concentration.
-Are you kidding? Our boy Chris is unshakable!
AThe next play starts. Chris drops back, looking for an opening...
Hey, rookie! I'm open!
...
Chris throws the ball, and...
Touchdown, baby!
What a throw!
That's our boy!
BG_EXT_CAMPUS_QUAD_NIGHT
jA while later, after a big win, you and your friends wait for Chris on the main quad, outside the stadium.
There he is!
Woo hoo! That's our superstar!
7Hey, guys! Thanks so much for being there for me today.

Of course!
You're... our friend.

{You}, I--
3He's interrupted as Becca and Madison approach him.
9Wow. That home run on sixth and long? Completely amazing.
=I can't even begin to tell you how wrong that sentence was...
^The point Maddie is trying to make is, you <i>need</i> to come celebrate your victory with us.
NYou should listen to them, bro. Kappa Phi Sigma house parties are <i>epic.</i>
WThe whole team is going! And that <i>definitely</i> has to include our new quarterback!
Chris looks over at you.
@Sure... I'd love to come. As long as my friends are invited too.
You mean <i>that</i> bunch of--
-Uh, I mean, of <i>course</i> they're invited.
$Sounds like fun. I'll see you there.
CNo way. I'm not letting you out of my sight. You're coming with me.
'Uh... I guess I'll see you there, guys!
HBecca takes Chris by the hand and starts leading him toward Kappa house.
Aggressive much?
VI hate to say it, but I think our boy needs a rescue. Those girls looked like trouble.
KSo... now it's time for Operation Rescue Chris from the Evil Sorority Girl?
$Maybe he doesn't want to be rescued?
Trust me. He does.
Everyone looks at you.
We need to rescue him...
The truth is...
Chris belongs with me!
Chris deserves better than her.
QI'm not just going to sit back and watch them steal Chris away from me! Let's go!
&I'm not sure how I feel about Chris...
rBut I <i>definitely</i> don't want to sit back and watch a good friend end up under the spell of a girl like that!
#Game on! Kappa party, here we come!
Maybe I could feel her out.
Girl recon. I love it!
I owe you one, {You}!
A few minutes later...
?Hey, Abbie! I'm coming down with a serious case of cabin fever.
"Want to head out and get some air?
fEh, sure. <i>The Crown and the Flame</i> isn't on for another half hour... I've got some time to kill.
0So... I didn't know you were into fantasy stuff?
(I guess I have pretty eclectic tastes...
XI try not to judge things by standards of cool or nerdy. Just... do I like it, you know?
Oh! Of course!
"Speaking of, uh, stuff you like...
What do you think of...
Comic books?
Nerdy guys?
EI'm a big fan of graphic novels like <i>Maus</i> and <i>Fun Home.</i>
,I'm guessing those aren't about superheroes?
8No. Though I do admit I have a soft spot for Spider-Man.
KBut I like him better when he's just Peter Parker, trying to live his life.
!So you're into quiet, nerdy guys?
Sure. I guess so.
EI don't know... I'm not exactly sure <i>what</i> kind of guys I like.
!Oh! So... you're more into girls?
:No... I mean... I'm pretty sure I'm not into girls either.
8I guess... I'm just a little confused about what I want.
)Huh. Do you have like, a celebrity crush?
Not really...
RHonestly, I think if I ever fall for someone, it'll be because of his personality.
*The thing is... I've never fallen in love.
7So... I don't know what it'll take to make that happen.
-Maybe you just haven't met the right guy yet.
Or maybe you have!
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm talking about...
Just... someone you know!
Tyler!
KI'm just saying, the love of your life could be someone you already know...
:Well, the only guys I know around here are our suitemates.
SZack is obviously off the table... and frankly, Chris seems more interested in you.
I guess that just leaves Tyler.
I suppose you're right...
%But I don't think he even notices me.
0Tyler, huh? I hadn't even considered dating him.
Really? Harsh.
JI didn't mean it like that. It's just... he's barely said two words to me.
+It's almost like he's scared to talk to me!
>So... what do you think you'd do if he <i>did</i> ask you out?
	Honestly?
I have no idea.
GWell... just think about it, I guess. You never know what might happen.
Relationship Improved
0Tyler and Abbie's relationship will be affected.
tyler_abbie
I'll think about it.
@I guess... I barely know who I am. Much less who I want to date.
GSometimes... I think life has a way of forcing us to decide who we are.
BLike... we only find out who we are when a crucial moment arrives.
7In that case... I guess I'm just waiting for my moment."
