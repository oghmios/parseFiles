Chapter Six: Kappa House Party
The Freshman
You
BG_EXT_SORORITY_HOUSE_NIGHT
hA few hours after the game, you and your friends are at the Kappa Phi party. There's only one problem...
HI can't believe we're still waiting to get in! Is this line even moving?
SAD
Kaitlyn
oUnbelievable. Those girls dragged Chris inside, and we're stuck out here waiting in line like... like non-VIPs!
ANGRY
Abbie
We <i>are</i> non-VIPs.
Tyler
OYou're <i>totally</i> a VIP, Abbie! But... I am starting to regret coming here.
	SURPRISED
Zack
aAre we <i>really</i> the type of people who scurry back to our dorm at the first sign of trouble?
YNo, but that one guy on the football team is guarding the door, and he has a <i>list!</i>
So?
1Well, if I had to guess, I'd say we're not on it.
CAs far as I'm concerned, we belong at the top of <i>every</i> list.
HAPPY
[We're getting into this party ASAP, before those harpies get their hands all over your man.
Zack...
NEUTRAL
I never said Chris was 'mine.'
!They'd better stay away from him!

Right, right... no labels.
;Are you even listening to me? Chris and I are just friends!
WSo... let's make sure your <i>friend</i> doesn't end up dating some evil sorority girl!
6We've got to do this for the sake of the <i>suite!</i>
sCan you imagine what our lives are gonna be like if Chris has one of those vapid social climbers over all the time?
`They say that suffering helps forge great art... but I don't need my art to be <i>that</i> good!
?We can't have that! We <i>can't</i> let Chris date those girls!
CWell... yeah. For Chris's own sake, we need to get him out of here.
 They messed with the wrong girl.
Okay, you're scaring me now.

I love it.
Abbie, {You}... let's go.
.Say what?! You're leaving me and Tyler behind?
iSorry, guys... but this is the sad reality. Cute girls <i>always</i> get into parties. Guys have to wait.
]But this is a <i>sorority</i> party! If anything, guys should have an easier time getting in.
-You are <i>so</i> not making sense right now.
What do you think, {You}?
"I think I'll try to get in with...
Who do I go with?
Kaitlyn
Zack
Yay! Good choice!

Ugh. Fine. See you inside.
kYou, Kaitlyn, and Abbie approach the front of the line, where a football player bars the door to the house.
Logan
$Hold on, girls. Are you on the list?
3Yeah. We're listed under 'Girls.' First name 'Hot.'
>Yep. 'Hot girls.' There you are, right at the top. Head on in.
Girl Power!
You got into the Kappa party.
BG_INT_SORORITY_HOUSE_NIGHT
Was I right or what, {You}?
You were right.
JOkay. Time to find Chris, save the day and... hold the phone. Jello shots!
2Kaitlyn grabs two jello shots and downs them both.
=So. Good. All the fun of being a kid plus, you know, alcohol.
0Abbie grabs a cup and licks the jello's surface.
This tastes like poison.
$I... I think I see Chris over there!
8You guys stay here with the jello... I'm going in alone.
)Awesome. I can't wait to be proven right!
We'll see...
`You and Zack approach the front of the line, where a football player bars the door to the house.
.Hold it right there, bro. Are you on the list?
!I think so... let me take a look.
ZZack grabs the list, then whips out a pen and writes his name and phone number at the top.
6Yep. There I am. Feel free to give me a call sometime.
$I'm into girls... but I'm flattered.
7Is this the part where you tell me to get back in line?
WBingo. Of course, if the hottie next to you wants to come in, that's a different story.
You mean me?
.You know it. Just don't forget who got you in.
1You go get Chris... we'll see you once we get in!
,Inside, you spot Chris and walk over to him.
Madison
(So be honest, Chris... are you ticklish?
Becca
9Your bottle is empty, Chris! Let me get you another beer!
]That last story was <i>hilarious.</i> Don't you dare tell another one until I get back, okay?
Chris
Heh. Sure thing.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_FUN_CHILL
Hey, Chris!
>{You}! There you are! I thought maybe you decided not to come.
1I just got a little... delayed. But I'm here now.
I'm glad you came...
,Chris takes you aside and whispers to you...
'I've been thinking about you all night.
Chris...
"I've been thinking about you, too.
Don't waste your time on me.

It's a party. Be more fun!
Relationship Improved
.Your relationship with Chris will be affected.
&There's something I wanted to ask you.
I know we said no promises...
,Did we? Because I'm starting to regret that.
FAnd for now, at least, it looks like I don't have to leave Hartfeld...
You, I--
Who says it's a waste of time?
!You don't give up easily, do you?
0Should I? If you really want me to back off, I--
#Brooding isn't a good look for you.
This is a party! Loosen up!
4'Fun,' huh? I think I remember hearing about that...
MUSIC_COLLEGE_ACTION_FUN
OYou're interrupted as Becca approaches and throws her arm around Chris's waist.
^Why's this girl keep following you around, Chris? <i>Please</i> tell me you're not dating her.
 {You}... {You} is a good friend.
HChris... I was actually wondering if you had a few more minutes to talk.
SSorry, but you had your chance. Plus, I already told Chris he's mine for the night.
WKappa house party rules! If you <i>really</i> want Chris, you've got to <i>win</i> him.
(He gestures to a nearby beer pong table.
3Did you just make up rules for <i>our</i> sorority?
/Logan! You're supposed to be guarding the door!
$Eh. I got bored and let everyone in.
IYou look around and realize all of your friends have gathered around you.
ZA beer pong match to get some time with Chris... I <i>do</i> love a game with high stakes!
You've got this, {You}!
<I'm not some trophy to be won and paraded around... usually!
 Objection noted. Now let's play!
cWhat do you say? {You} versus Becca. The winner gets ten minutes with our new starting quarterback.
qGladly. I haven't lost a match since freshman year. And I know <i>exactly</i> how I want to spend my ten minutes.
I just want to talk to Chris.
(What do I do?)
Play the game.

Walk away.
It's on.
=A few minutes later, you and Becca face off across the table.

MUSIC_COLLEGE_TENSE_ACTION
CThe crowd cheers, and your friends hoist you up on their shoulders!
0That's my girl! Beer pong champion of the world!
-Looks like you've won me for a few minutes...
5And I plan to make the most of my time. Come with me.
QThe crowd cheers, and several football players hoist Becca up on their shoulders!
*Go Becca! Beer pong champion of the world!
-And now for my reward... come with me, Chris.
Chris looks back at you.
>We're just going to talk, okay? I'll be back in a few minutes.
1Sure thing... I'll just wait here looking stupid.
I swear I'll be right back.
:You head back to a couch where your friends are waiting...
Well... this is fun.
9How many minutes has it been since Chris left with Becca?
Like... one?
)I'm sure they're just... chatting. Right?
"Nine excruciating minutes later...
@{You}! There you are! Come on, now's my chance to talk with you.
$I'm done playing games. I'm leaving.
You storm out...

{You}... wait! Let's talk.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_LOVE_SAD
;You and Chris head outside, where you can speak in private.
>So... what's going on? It seems like you had something to say.
4I just... I didn't like seeing you with those girls.
iMadison and Becca? You should give them a chance! They're actually pretty cool once you get to know them.
Somehow I really doubt that.
,Well... they've been nothing but nice to me.
FThey don't even know you! All they see is a guy in a football uniform!
GOh... so you're assuming there's no other reason someone might like me?
*That's not what I said. I'm just saying...
Becca is so...
Aggressive.
Manipulative.
Nice!
-Becca knows what she wants, and she takes it.
Yeah, by force.
PI'm not sure about that... if anything, I think Becca is pretty straightforward.
HSee! The fact that you think that <i>proves</i> how manipulative she is!
OI think... I think Becca is someone who knows what she wants, and she takes it.
OFirst you say you don't trust Becca... then you say she's nice. I don't get it.
#Maybe I'm a little confused myself.
7That's actually something I really like about Becca....
+She knows what she wants, and she takes it.
FIt must be nice to be so... certain. Do you know what <i>you</i> want?
]I don't know. Maybe that's why I admire Becca... because I'm so all over the place right now.
.So what can I do to help you get some clarity?
{You}... I...
(What do I do?)
	Kiss him!

chris_kiss
Hug him.
Do nothing.
-I'm sorry... I'm just... not sure how I feel.
 I hated seeing you with Becca...
2But I'm not sure that means I want to be with you.
Chris takes a step back.
TSo that's it... you saw me with another girl and didn't want me to start dating her?
I guess... kinda?
)I'm sorry. This must be pretty confusing.
Well... yeah.
I really do care about you.
So... what do we do now?
Honestly... I don't know.
8I think I do know. I'm falling for you. Hard. {You}, I--
+Suddenly, a look of panic crosses his face.
SI... I can't believe it. I'm doing the exact thing I promised myself I wouldn't do.
BDidn't I say it the first day I met you... I'm not ready for this.
!I'm not ready for something real.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_LOVE
Making Moves!
'You kissed Chris at the sorority party!
RChris's lips meet yours as he runs a hand through your hair, pulling you in close.
=Tell me there's not still something here, and I'll walk away.
There's still something here...
Z{You}... that first time I met you... I'd never felt a spark like that with <i>anyone</i>.
,I <i>know</i> we have an amazing connection.
RHe leans in for another kiss, pressing you against the wall of the sorority house.
Oh... Chris...
fYou slip into the shadows by the side of the house, and Chris kisses you softly up and down your neck.
/People are going to realize... we're missing...
So what?
(What do I do?)
Keep kissing Chris.
Have a conversation.
 You pull Chris in even closer...
HFor the past few days, I haven't been able to stop thinking about you...
=Shivers run through you as he presses his body against yours.
Chris... someone might see...
-No one's out here... and it's totally dark...
&Unless you're scared we'll get caught.
Chris...
Don't stop now.
We should slow down.
I'm not scared.
Then neither am I.
Oh, Chris...
ESlowly, the world seems to fade into nothing as you hold Chris close.
...
...
A while later...
Out in Public
"You and Chris got wild at a party!
*That was amazing... <i>You're</i> amazing.
You're not so bad yourself.
7Of course... I would never want to pressure you into...
VNo... I mean... I don't know. I really like you, but this just isn't the right moment.
4Of course, you're still free to kiss me if you like.
$I'm never going to say no to that...
AYou melt into Chris's arms as he pulls you close for a long kiss.
...
GChris, you know I care about you, but I want to talk, not just hook up.
FOf course! I love talking to you! I want to know everything about you!
Really?
Don't sound so surprised.
II'm planning to spend a <i>lot</i> of time getting to know you this year.
That sounds good. Very good.
$So... are we... what does this mean?
Honestly... I don't know.
DMaybe it means we should be together. Like... as a couple. For real.
KYou lean in toward Chris and lace your fingers around the back of his neck.
.I think maybe you're right. I think maybe I...
+Suddenly, a look of panic crosses his face.
SI... I can't believe it. I'm doing the exact thing I promised myself I wouldn't do.
BDidn't I say it the first day I met you... I'm not ready for this.
!I'm not ready for something real.
DI'm so, so sorry, {You}. I should never have let things go this far.
Chris...
Don't do this.
I understand.
;I know you're scared... but you can't just throw this away!
5I... I think I need to be alone for a little while...
CI'm so, so sorry, {You}. You deserve better than me. You really do.
/I... I understand. We said 'no promises' right?

Yeah. That's what we said.
CI'm so, so sorry, {You}. You deserve better than me. You really do.
Yo, Chris! Where you at?
Chris? Chris? Are you out here?
EIt... it sounds like I'd better head back in. Goodbye for now, {You}.
Chris, wait...
&He walks back into the sorority house.
BG_EXT_CAMPUS_QUAD_NIGHT
ZA few minutes later, you're walking around campus, trying to process what just happened...
@Hey! There you are! We looked everywhere for you. What happened?
!I... don't want to talk about it.
>The last thing I saw was Chris walking inside to go see Becca.
CAnd now he's not here walking home with us. Do you think maybe he--
Let's not even talk about it.
JMaybe it's better just to get some sleep and forget tonight ever happened.
>Actually... I have to write about 'football life' for Vasquez.
I'll write about...
%Football players' relationship drama.
The party scene.
The game itself.
>Sounds like my kind of essay! I'll look forward to reading it!

=You spend all night at your laptop, writing your heart out...
BG_INT_OFFICE_PROFESSOR
MUSIC_COLLEGE_COMEDY_MISCHIEF
And the next day...
James
fThere you are. It looks like you <i>somehow</i> managed to satisfy the professor with your assignment.
Is it that hard to believe?
<Honestly? Yes. He pretty much hates everyone and everything.
Consider me impressed.
%I'll try not to let it go to my head.
CYou catch James's grin just as Professor Vasquez clears his throat.

Star Pupil
,Your standing with Vasquez will be affected.
Vasquez
lThis... this is perfect. It's got all the heartache of a Victorian romance, but situated in a modern milieu.
0And the evil sorority girl is a perfect villain.

Star Pupil
,Your standing with Vasquez will be affected.
NThis... this is perfect. These are the sort of rich details I was looking for.
RWho knew jello shots still existed? I thought those went out of style in the '70s!
0And the evil sorority girl is a perfect villain.
;Sounds a little dry... but maybe that's what Vasquez wants.
=You spend all night at your laptop, writing your heart out...
And the next day...
Bottom of the Curve
,Your standing with Vasquez will be affected.
cThere you are. As expected, your assignment completely failed to meet the Professor's expectations.
DBut don't take it too personally. He hates everyone. And everything.
XI thought your writing was totally adequate though slightly dry. It bordered on... good.
UWow. Easy with the compliments. I'll try not to let all of this praise go to my head.
CYou catch James's grin just as Professor Vasquez clears his throat.
>'The touchdown was good, followed by yet another extra point!'
eIf I'd wanted a banal recounting of the facts, I would have picked up a copy of the school newspaper!
aI recruited you to get me a <i>true</i> insight into student life. This... this is surface level.
*This essay is worse than bad. It's boring.
<I... I'm really sorry, okay? I just had a really hard night.
GMy friend Chris apparently fell in love with this evil sorority girl...
EAnd we got stuck at this awful party with a bunch of horrible people.
 Awful party? Evil sorority girl?
2<i>Those</i> are the details I want to hear about.
;In fact... I think I just figured out your next assignment!
:<i>You</i> are going to join the Kappa Phi Sigma sorority!
...
Round One...

Time to...
Score!
Miss.
Drop...
 
Great shot!
That's what I'm talking about!
That could have gone better...
Round Two...

My turn...
;<i>You should try to distract her! Get inside her head!</i>
Hey, Becca...
I love your outfit!
You look so pretty!
There's a stain on your dress!
A stain? What? Where?!
Becca's shot misses wide!
Great work!
>Oops. I guess it wasn't a stain at all. Just a shadow. My bad!
Sorry you missed your shot.
It's not over yet...

Thanks for the compliment!

She easily sinks her shot.
Ugh.
 You're making this way too easy.
Round Three...
>I've been watching you toss... and I think I have some advice.
BAdding a little <red>backspin</red> will help you sink more shots.
)Nothing's gonna help {You} win this game!
_Are you guys talking physics? Because I've got a lot of thoughts on the trajectory of the ball.
OSee, if {You} was able to increase the angle of her arc by about ten degrees...
Guys... I'm getting confused.
>Don't listen to anyone else, {You}! Just remember what I said!
Gotta use some...

Frontspin!
	Sidespin!
	Backspin!
Great work!
Nothing but net!
You've got to be kidding me...
No...
)Too bad, {You}. That was <i>so</i> close!
&It all comes down to the final shot...
Here goes nothing.
HYour ball sails through the air... and lands right in Becca's final cup!
,That's... that's impossible! I'm unbeatable!
Queen of Pong
You beat Becca at beer pong!
;Correction. You <i>were</i> unbeatable. Until I came along.
2Becca closes her eyes... and makes the shot blind!

That... that's impossible.
Loser's Bracket
Becca beat you at beer pong!
?Don't take it too hard, sweetie. Some of us are born winners...
#And other people... well, you know."
