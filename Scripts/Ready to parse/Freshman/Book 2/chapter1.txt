Chapter One: Winter in Hartfeld
The Freshman
You
BG_EXT_CAMPUS_QUAD_WINTER_DAY
èOn the first day of winter quarter, your mom parks the family car in one of the campus parking lots and gets out to help you with your luggage.
Mom
0<jiggle>Brrr!</jiggle> It's so <i>cold</i> here!
	SURPRISED
QGood thing I took you shopping for winter clothes, huh? Told you you'd need them.
HAPPY
Enter your name.
!Yup, I'm eternally grateful, Mom.
So... are you glad to be back?
Of course! I really missed...
NEUTRAL
My friends!
Partying all day, every day!
Sharing a bed with someone...
(You're so lucky your roommates are nice.
ëI still have nightmares about the girl <i>I</i> lived with my freshman year... I'll never get the sound of her toenail clippers out of my head...
SAD
1Yikes... something tells me I don't want to know.
%Is <i>that</i> all you've been doing?
=Well, that and petty crimes. I'm trying to stay well-rounded.
fVery funny. Just make sure you take full advantage of your time here, okay? These are important years.
I <i>know</i>, mother...
/TMI, {You}. I did <i>not</i> need to hear that.
>But you're my <i>mom</i>. I thought I could tell you anything?
xThat doesn't mean you get to brag about your sex life. How would you feel if I kept you informed of your father and my--
Agh, stop, I'm sorry!
That's what I thought.
TYou look around the snow-covered campus, shielding your eyes against the winter sun.
1Let me guess... looking for that special someone?
Maybe...
ÉSo, is it, you know... <i>official</i>? I know you young people 'don't do labels,' but you <i>did</i> go to formal together, right?
I'd say that's pretty official.

UWell, if your trip to L.A. together is any indication, I'd say you mean a lot to him.
%Might be time to get official, {You}.
iWell, if your little trip to Northbridge together is any indication, it sounds like she really likes you.
%Might be time to get official, {You}.
cConsidering he took you to a <i>masquerade ball</i> over break, I'd say you're very special to him.

aJust then, you spot Chris approaching through the snow. He waves at you, a big smile on his face.
@Wow, the pictures you showed me did <i>not</i> do him justice...
Mom!
Just... be cool!
You need to leave NOW!
Sorry!
/Chris jogs over and sweeps you up in a big hug!
!<jiggle>Whoa!</jiggle> Down, boy!
Sorry... just happy to see you.
5Chris puts you down and holds out a hand to your mom.
'Hi, you must be {You}'s mom. I'm Chris.
&So handsome! And a strong grip, too...
GMom, what did I <i>just</i> say? You're gonna creep the poor guy out...
@Heh, no harm done. I certainly don't mind being called handsome.
TI'm starting to see why {You} never shut up about you the whole time she was home...
?Really? I wouldn't mind hearing what she had to say, exactly...
Agghh, stop!
<This meet-and-greet is officially over. Good<i>bye</i>, mom.
ANGRY
LAll right, I'll leave you two alone. It was nice to finally meet you, Chris.
2{You}, make sure to call home at least once, okay?
I'll do my best. Bye!
Bye, sweetheart.
\As your mom gets back in her car and drives away, Chris grins and shoulders your duffel bag.
But I want to meet Chris!
JAre you kidding? It's <i>way</i> too soon for that! Go on, get outta here!
MOkay, okay... but I expect you to call home at least once this quarter, okay?

I'll do my best. Bye, mom!
Bye, sweetheart.
aAs your mom gets back in her car and drives away, Chris jogs over and sweeps you up in a big hug!
!<jiggle>Whoa!</jiggle> Down, boy!
Sorry... just happy to see you.
;Was that your mom just now? I would've liked to meet her...
0Oh, uh... she had an errand to run. Very urgent.
	Riiiight.
Don't give me that look.
*Chris grins and shoulders your duffel bag.
IC'mon, let's get you back to the suite. Everyone's been dying to see you.
Awww...
0I think I need some alone time with you first...
 I can't wait to see them either!
jI was thinking the same thing. But I'm pretty sure they're gonna grab you as soon as you walk in the door.
?I guess we'll just have to stay out here a while longer then...
bYou stand up on your tiptoes and press your lips against Chris's, laying your hand on his chest...
Guess so...
kChris drops your bag in the snow and kisses you deeply, wrapping his arms around you and holding you close.
eFinally, you break apart and gaze into each other's eyes for a long second. Chris smiles down at you.
]Let's finish this later. Our suitemates will kill me if I keep you away from them any longer.
,Well, I wouldn't want that. Let's go say hi.
They'll be happy to hear that.
cYou take Chris's hand in yours, and the two of you walk across campus toward your suite together...
{Just then, you spot Kaitlyn approaching through the snow. She raises both hands to wave at you, a bright smile on her face.
3Ooh, is that Kaitlyn? Wow, she's <i>gorgeous</i>...
Mom!
Just... be cool!
You need to leave NOW!
Sorry!
SKaitlyn hurries over and pulls you into a warm hug, spinning you around in the air!
<shake_portrait/>Aaaahhh!
,{You}! I haven't seen you in, like, forever!
5Kaitlyn sets you down and extends a hand to your mom.
Hi, {You}'s mom. I'm Kaitlyn.
aSo <i>you're</i> the girl who's been spiriting my daughter away on weekend trips to the big city.
I'm afraid so.
YAha. I'm starting to see why {You} never shut up about you the whole time she was home...
<Ooh, do tell... what exactly did {You} have to say about me?
Agghh, stop!
<This meet-and-greet is officially over. Good<i>bye</i>, mom.
NAll right, I'll leave you two alone. It was nice to finally meet you, Kaitlyn.
2{You}, make sure to call home at least once, okay?
I'll do my best. Bye!
Bye, sweetheart.
yAs your mom gets back in her car and drives away, Kaitlyn links her arm in yours and leans over to kiss you on the cheek.
But I want to meet Kaitlyn!

HKaitlyn sets you down and peers after the car shrinking in the distance.
;Was that your mom just now? I would've liked to meet her...
0Oh, uh... she had an errand to run. Very urgent.
-Riiiight. I get it, you're embarrassed of me.
;Don't be ridiculous. My <i>mom</i> is the embarrassing one.
$I know what that's like, believe me.
GKaitlyn links her arm in yours and leans over to kiss you on the cheek.
CCan I walk you back to the suite? Everyone's been dying to see you.
Awww...
0I think I need some alone time with you first...
 I can't wait to see them either!
-Funny, I was thinking the exact same thing...
QBut I'm pretty sure everyone's going to ambush us as soon as we walk in the door.
?I guess we'll just have to stay out here a while longer then...
dYou snake your arm around Kaitlyn's waist and pull her close until your bodies are flush together...
Guess so...
vKaitlyn lays a hand on your cheek and kisses you deeply, her lips soft and warm against yours in the chill winter air.
YFinally, you break apart, and Kaitlyn's eyes flutter open, a shy smile curving her mouth.
xOur suitemates won't be happy if I keep you away from them any longer... but let's make time to finish this later, okay?
What's wrong with right now?
/I want to do things that we can't do in public.
IOh, you do, huh? Okay, I guess I can wait... let's go say hi to everyone.
Then let's go!
aYou shoulder your duffel bag, and the two of you walk across campus toward your suite together...
ÄJust then, you spot James approaching through the snow. He raises a hand to wave at you, a slight smile playing across his face.
!<i>That's</i> James? Lucky you...
Mom!
Just... be cool!
You need to leave NOW!
Sorry!
TJames strides over and plants a kiss on your cheek, then extends a hand to your mom.
-You must be {You}'s mother. I'm James Ashton.
MWhat a gentleman! Where were guys like you when <i>I</i> was a freshman, huh?
GMom, what did I <i>just</i> say? You're gonna creep the poor guy out...
2On the contrary, it's an honor to meet you, ma'am.
^Likewise. I'm starting to see why {You} never shut up about you the whole time she was home...
Is that so?
Agghh, stop!

Hey.
;Was that your mom just now? I would've liked to meet her...
0Oh, uh... she had an errand to run. Very urgent.
bRiiiight. It's not like you already met <i>my</i> parents in the most embarrassing way possible...
ATrust me, my mom would find a way to be <i>more</i> embarrassing.
If you say so.
*James grins and shoulders your duffel bag.
WCome on, I'll walk you to your suite. I'm sure your friends have been dying to see you.
Awww...
 I can't wait to see them either!
0I think I need some alone time with you first...
I thought you might say that.
cYou take James's hand in yours, and the two of you walk across campus toward your suite together...
mI was hoping you'd say that. But I'm pretty sure your roommates will grab you as soon as we walk in the door.

kJames drops your bag in the snow and kisses you deeply, wrapping his arms around you and holding you close.
eFinally, you break apart and gaze into each other's eyes for a long second. James smiles down at you.
_To be continued. Your suitemates are likely to kill me if I keep you away from them any longer.

fAs you and Chris cross the quad, you spot a glamorous young woman looking around campus, clearly lost.

HAbbie! Aw, it's so good to see you guys. I really missed you over break.
`Same! Now, enough small talk... Abbie has some <i>serious</i> gossip to share, don't you, Abbie?

As I recall...
 You two went to formal together.
 Tyler went to formal with Leila.
,I assume things went pretty well after that?
You assume correctly.
gWe didn't meet up over break, but we <i>did</i> talk online a lot. And on the phone. And on video chat.
/You were pretty upset with him for that, right?
Yeah, I was <i>not</i> happy.
}But apparently she was really clingy throughout the whole thing, and Tyler pretty much realized he'd made a terrible mistake.
Got it.
{Anyway, we didn't meet up over break or anything, but we <i>did</i> talk online a lot. And on the phone. And on video chat.

Aw, Abbie!
*Are you two finally together for real now?
(Wait, video chat? Clothes or no clothes?
&Abbie blushes and catches Tyler's eye.
*What do you think, Tyler? Are we together?
'Tyler looks up from his game and grins.
Totally.
<i>Awwwwww!</i>
Oh my god, {You}!
(You didn't answer the question, Abbie...

Clothes, <i>obviously</i>.
-It is <i>way</i> too soon for... <i>that.</i>
,Tyler perks up and looks away from his game.
Too soon for what?
Dude, focus!
xTyler looks back at the screen just as Yothag, Thrall of Xelia devours his character with one snap of his spectral jaws.
<shake_portrait/>Nooooo!
Game over, man.
}See what I have to deal with, {You}? Ever since these two got back from break, they've been making googly eyes at each other.
*It's completely throwing off Tyler's game!
VYou, Kaitlyn, and Abbie sit down on the couch while Tyler powers off the game console.
<Oh yeah? Speaking of game, how's your love life going, Zack?
Last time I checked...
2You and Brandon were the hottest couple at formal!
*You still hadn't really asked Brandon out.
DOh, we're still the hottest couple at basically any social function.
'Except now it's a little more official.
XOld news, my friend. I asked him out, he said yes, and long story short, we're official.

$As you walk into Vasquez's office...
Vasquez
D{You}. What took you so long? I've been waiting for... <i>Hrrrk.</i>
rVasquez coughs into a handkerchief. When he pulls it away, you notice a red spot bleeding through the white cloth.
IHe quickly stuffs the handkerchief in his pocket before James can see it.
Professor, are you--
3I'm fine. James, could you get me a glass of water?
DFor a moment, James lingers. Then he nods and walks out of the room.
You need to tell him.
7Don't you dare try to tell me what I <i>need</i> to do.
b<i>You</i> need to remember who's in charge here... who holds your future in the palm of his hand.
Well...
At least I have a future!

I'm sorry.
Still dramatic as ever.
FI suppose I should thank you. It's all wonderful material for my book.
HInteresting. Last quarter, you would have barked back some insult at me.
2Perhaps you're capable of evolving as a character.
"I'm not a character. I'm a person.
Whatever you say...
@Back to your question. I'll tell James when the moment is right.
'You mean when it causes the most drama?
No... when I'm ready.
gJust then, the office door bursts open, and the young woman from before enters with James at her heels.
:Professor Vasquez. How nice to finally meet you in person.
????
1Allow me to introduce myself... I'm Yasmin Udoka.
>I'm sorry, Professor. I tried to tell her you were busy, but--
[It's my job to push for what I want, James. It's what makes me the best agent in Manhattan.
bI'm afraid you're about forty years too late to sign me. I already have an agent! Charles Wallace!
\Charlie retired on Tuesday. I took over his client list and jumped on the first flight here.
uI used the plane ride to catch up on your latest book. <i>Very</i> provocative stuff. Especially the {You} character.
1Vasquez! You actually named your character {You}?
RYou should be grateful! You're being immortalized in a work of classic literature!
\If half the stories I read are true, you've had quite an interesting freshman year so far...
Oh yeah?
It's been pretty fun.
#What exactly did he write about me?
Those are all lies!
'I'm not sure 'fun' is the word I'd use.
Huh?
5Never mind, on to business. What do you want, Yasmin?
^Oh, I <i>wish</i> I could tell you, but I couldn't possibly violate Vasquez's trust like that.
MI guess I'll just have to wait for the book to come out like everyone else...
)On to business. What do you want, Yasmin?
<No need to get defensive. You don't even know what he wrote.
#Well, I'm sure none of it was good.
(That depends on your definition of good.
!Enough. What do you want, Yasmin?
[First, a little bookkeeping. We need to renew publication rights for <i>Winter in July</i>.
KThat includes going digital! I'm afraid no one reads print anymore, dear...
çDon't patronize me. Just because our entire culture's sinking into a morass of shallow self-absorption doesn't mean I have to help the slide.
gAll I need is your signature, Enrique. Then you can go back to your ivory tower and sneer all you want.
5I... I'm not ready to sign. I need to think about it.
âWhat's there to think about? Your book sales could double or even <i>triple</i> if we release <i>Winter in July</i> on digital platforms.
dI said I need to think about it, okay? As far as I'm concerned, the matter is closed for discussion.
qI'd rather focus on finishing <i>The Freshman</i>. Hopefully it will serve as a cautionary tale to today's youth.

Yeah... a cautionary tale.
As in...
Never trust your professor!
%Try not to date three people at once!
9You've clearly misidentified the theme of my book, {You}.
LWhether you trust me or not is a moot point. You <i>have</i> to work for me.
vSo it's a book about the way millennials are subjugated by a corrupt power structure set up by <i>your</i> generation?
&Interesting take. I like that angle...
;But... it still ignores the main character's central flaws.
1Heh. I'm not exactly sure I'd call it 'dating...'
@But that's part of what makes you such an interesting character!
<i>I'm not a character!</i>
IOn the contrary. You're one of the greatest characters I've ever written.
2You're a flawed protagonist worthy of Shakespeare.
:What flaws? I bet you can't even come up with one example.
zActually, I've got half a book's worth of examples. And by the end of the year, I should have enough to finish this thing.
:I take that to mean, you don't have any more pages for me?
?Actually... I'm just getting an idea for my next chapter now...
IOf course, this is going to require a bit of 'help' from {You} and James.
IWhoa, whoa, whoa. Leave me out of this. I'm your mentee, not your puppet.
RHear me out. There's a nice benefit in this for you, if you play your cards right.
UHere's my proposal: {You} is going to put on James's play, here on campus, next week!
UAnd Yasmin here is going to watch. If she likes it, she'll take James on as a client!
I will?
âThink of the drama! James's future on the line... an agent out to land her first client after inheriting a bunch of literary dinosaurs...
fAnd at the center of it all, a girl who risks losing her scholarship and getting thrown out of school!
=That <i>does</i> sound compelling. Very well, then. I accept.
TI'll look forward to watching your play, Mr. Ashton. It had better be worth my time.
PHow am I supposed to put on a play just like that? I don't even know any actors!
'Oh, you won't be using actors, {You}...
^The stars of <i>this</i> play will be a few of my favorite characters... you and your friends!
BG_EXT_CAMPUS_PARK_WINTER_DAY
kAs you and Chris walk across the quad, you stop by the frozen fountain and look down at the glistening ice.
GIt seems like a long time ago since we had a slip 'n slide set up here.
$Yeah. The campus looks so different.
-I guess a lot has changed since fall quarter.
Not everything.
WChris takes your hand and leads you to a booth serving roasted chestnuts and hot cocoa.
YMmm... maybe it's just because I'm freezing, but this is the best thing I've ever tasted.
MIf you're cold, it's the perfect time for me to give you your Christmas gift!
@Chris reaches into his backpack and produces a crinkled package.
I, uh, wrapped it myself.
>You tear open the paper to reveal a pair of soft, wool gloves.
UWow... these are the softest gloves I've ever owned! And they're just the right size!
(I can't take all of the credit for that.
yI got them at the clothing shop where my mom works... I showed her a picture of you, and she was able to guess your size.
That's a pretty neat trick.
I'll tell her you said that.
I didn't realize your mom works in a clothing store. I guess I don't really hear that many stories about your life back home...
NI... don't like to talk about it. But I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Tell me about...
Your family.
Your hometown.
Your break.
NLet's see... there's me. My mom. My brother Kyle is 10, and my sister Jo is 8.

Your dad--
Was a long haul trucker.
'Was'?
3Let's... not get into that today. It's a happy day.
*My mom, Kyle, and Jo are everything to me.
2I'm not going to lie. It was hard to be back home.
MNow that I've seen more of the world, Cherryfield, Maine looks awfully small.
7Cherryfield, Maine. The blueberry capital of the world.
'So then why is it called... never mind.
$I'd love to take you there sometime.
%It's beautiful... but also dirt poor.
FThere's the high school, a tiny downtown, and exactly two restaurants.
yIf I couldn't throw a football, I'd probably still be there, scraping by like the rest of the guys I went to school with.
2I'm not going to lie. It was hard to be back home.
BNow that I've seen more of the world, my town looks awfully small.
,It was great to see my family. It always is.
?I gave my little sister a game ball signed by the whole team...
PAnd she and my little brother promptly went outside to play with it in the snow.
She sounds like a troublemaker.
You don't know the half of it.
6But I'm not going to lie. It was hard to be back home.
NIt's beautiful, of course... but the people are dirt poor, and mostly unhappy.
MNow that I've seen more of the world, Cherryfield, Maine looks awfully small.
And... of course, I missed you.
Huh.

What's with the slack jaw?
<It's just... I feel like I know you so well in certain ways.
3The two of us have had some real adventures, but...
'I didn't even know you were from Maine.
NTrust me, it's not important. My past is the least interesting thing about me.
 I'm sure that's not true, Chris.
RBut for the sake of enjoying this date, I'm going to let you off the hook for now.
	Lucky me.
@You take Chris's hand and start pulling him into the snowy quad.
<Come on. We're at a winter fair! Let's do some winter stuff.
How about we build a snowman?
2Sure thing... but I'm fresh out of magic top hats.
1Guess we'll have to use our imaginations instead.
^Chris hunkers down and starts packing snow together. Soon, you're kneeling beside him to help.
NWe can use two of the chestnuts for his eyes! We can name him... Mr. Chestnut.
Wow. How creative.
'Hey! You're going to hurt his feelings!
"Aw. Poor guy. Sorry, Mr. Chestnut.
$You notice Chris shivering slightly.
OI didn't realize since I was wearing gloves... but your hands must be freezing!
Quick...
Borrow these gloves!
Get some fresh cocoa!
Put your hands inside my coat!
$You hand the gloves to Chris, but...
CThese gloves are perfectly sized for <i>you!</i> They won't fit me!
Oh yeah.
#Chris hands the gloves back to you.
4Please... put these back on before you get cold too.
8I couldn't stand to watch you shiver. Even for a second.
EYou and Chris run back to the cocoa stand and quickly get fresh cups.
That feels so... good...
8Careful. You're going to make me jealous of a cocoa cup.
Maybe you should be.
Are you sure?
Just do it!
FChris reaches under your coat, and his icy hands touch your warm skin.
So... cold!
You told me to do this!
I... I know.
4After a few moments, Chris's hands start to warm up.
*This is... actually starting to feel nice.
2I almost forgot how much I missed you touching me.
Almost.
uAs the nearby string quartet begins to play a winter waltz, Chris takes your face in his hand, gazing into your eyes.
3While I was at home, I had a nightmare, you know...
sIn it, I showed up here today, and you didn't exist. Everything we'd shared last quarter had only been an illusion.
kI woke up in a cold sweat, picked up my phone, and scrolled through my old photos until I found one of you.
Aww, Chris...
MAnd then I knew you were real. And I took a deep breath and went back to bed.
VHe leans in and kisses you hard on the lips, his stubble lightly caressing your cheek.
'We... should find somewhere... private.
2Your phone beeps again, another text from Vasquez.
6Later tonight. We'll make up for lost time. I promise.
I'm going to hold you to that.
vYou and Kaitlyn cross the quad to the park, where a student string quartet plays holiday music by the frozen fountain.
ZKaitlyn turns to grin at you as the smell of roasting chestnuts and hot cocoa reaches you.
,Aren't you glad you decided to come with me?
Definitely.
ÑKaitlyn takes your hand and leads you over to a nearby booth, where a student volunteer fills two styrofoam cups with hot chocolate.
Thanks!
πClutching your steaming cups of hot cocoa, you and Kaitlyn walk through the park together, the soft strains of holiday music fading into the distance as you settle onto a private bench.
QKaitlyn sips her hot chocolate and smiles at you, her eyes bright with happiness.
What are you smiling about?
"Being with you, duh. I missed you.
-I missed you, too. Winter break was too long.
What'd you get up to?
Over winter break, I...
&Caught up with my high school friends.

Spent time with my family.
#Hid in my room and watched Netflix.
How was that?
AIt was good. Everyone's... different, but somehow still the same?
I know what you mean.
{Kaitlyn pulls your hand onto her lap, stroking your thumb with hers. She gives you a sly look out of the corner of her eye.
Are <i>you</i> different?
Maybe a little bit.
How was that?
It was... mostly good.
UMy dad still hasn't found work, but my mom was able to get her old job back at least.
That's good, right?
_Yeah... but it's just enough to support them. She's not exactly making college tuition money...
.I'm sorry... at least you have Vasquez, right?
Yeah... right.
DKaitlyn pulls your hand onto her lap, stroking your thumb with hers.
 It'll be okay, {You}. I promise.
+Thanks, Kaitlyn. Sorry for getting mopey...
I don't mind one bit.
Sounds like a good time.
Are you making fun of me?
Nope, not at all.
DKaitlyn pulls your hand onto her lap, stroking your thumb with hers.
Just invite me next time, okay?
Okay.
4So... how was your break? You were in Taiwan, right?
JYup! We always spend Christmas visiting family there. It was a lot of fun.
#Oh, cool! Do you have any pictures?
Yeah, I have a few...
=Kaitlyn pulls out her phone and swipes through a photo album.
7Here's me eating hotpot with my three little cousins...
Oh my god, they're so cute!
And here we are at the zoo...
They have <i>pandas</i>?
vMhmm. And here's a selfie I snapped at the top of Taipei 101 which is basically this giant tower with an awesome view.
EOoh, you look so sexy with your hair blowing in the wind like that...
6Wow, see if I ever show you any of my selfies again...
6Aw, I'm just teasing. You <i>do</i> look sexy, though.

So do you.
ÄKaitlyn reaches over and brushes a snowflake off your cheek, then leans in close, a smile tugging at the corners of her mouth...
Close your eyes...
AYou do as Kaitlyn tells you, waiting to feel her lips on yours...
4...but all you get is a face full of cold, wet snow!
<i>Kaitlyn!</i>
RKaitlyn giggles as you sputter through the snow, her eyes sparkling with laughter.
2Oh my <i>god</i>, I got you <i>so</i> good, {You}!
HIf I were you, I'd start running, cause you are in <i>big</i> trouble...
gKaitlyn shrieks and runs off through the park as you scoop up a handful of snow and fling it after her!
?I'm sorry, I swear! Won't you please forgive me? <i>Please</i>?
Let me think...
I don't think so!
Okay, you're forgiven.
2No way! Revenge is a dish best served <i>cold</i>.
FYour next snowball explodes against a tree as Kaitlyn ducks behind it!
Come on out, you coward!
Okay, you asked for it!
JKaitlyn charges out from behind her tree and tackles you into a snowdrift!
I can't stay mad at you.
=Kaitlyn ducks behind a tree and pokes her head out, grinning.
!How do I know this isn't a trick?
I guess you don't.
TKaitlyn ambles out from behind her tree to where you're standing and extends a hand.
Truce?
Truce.
OYou take Kaitlyn's hand to shake it... and she pulls you down into a snowdrift!
Seriously?!
tYou scrabble in the snow, trying to make a snowball to defend yourself, but she grabs your wrists and pins you down!
ELooks like I've got you right where I want you... ready to surrender?
(What should I say?)
Do your worst!

I'm yours.
<Kaitlyn smiles wickedly and leans in to whisper in your ear.
I was hoping you'd say that...
RYou gasp as Kaitlyn starts kissing your ear, her mouth hot in the cold winter air.
<i>Ohhh</i>...
`Kaitlyn's lips move lower until she's kissing your neck, making you squirm against the snowbank.

<i>Now</i> do you give up?
<i>N-no...</i>
Wrong answer.
qYou stifle a moan as Kaitlyn's mouth moves against your neck, her kisses harder and more insistent than before...
Okay, yes! I surrender!
0If you keep kissing me like that, I'm going to--
Going to what?
Lose control.
\Kaitlyn leans close and kisses you gently on the lips, her expression soft and affectionate.
I think I'd like to see that.
PI'm afraid you'll have to wait until we're somewhere warmer. And less... public.
%Kaitlyn smiles shyly, biting her lip.
What?
/Nothing, I just... I like hearing you say that.
mYou prop yourself up on one elbow and lay your hand along Kaitlyn's cheek, your fingers tangling in her hair.
I like saying it.
SKaitlyn leans down to kiss you, her mouth hot and insistent in the cold winter air.
[You moan softly as her tongue moves against yours, one of her hands settling on your chest.
+I really, <i>really</i> like this, {You}...
What? Making out with me?
(Well, yes, but I meant <i>us,</i> silly.
rI'm so happy that you feel this way about me. I don't know what I did to deserve you, but... I just feel so lucky.
1Now <i>you're</i> being silly. I'm the lucky one.
?Kaitlyn smiles and kisses you again, her eyes bright and happy.
BWhat do you say we take this someplace warmer and more... private?
!I can't... I have to <i>go</i>...
I know, I know...
[A short while later, Kaitlyn walks you back across campus toward the literature department.
5Well... that was nice. Thanks for making time for me.

Of course.
fDon't let Vasquez keep you <i>too</i> long. I'd like to spend some time with you later tonight, too...
)I'll try to be home at a reasonable hour.
I'll be waiting.
lKaitlyn gives you a quick kiss on the cheek, then walks off through the snow, leaving you to face Vasquez...
tYou and James cross the quad to the park, where a student string quartet plays holiday music by the frozen fountain.
XAs the smell of roasting chestnuts and hot cocoa reaches you, you turn to grin at James.
1I didn't think you were the type to play hooky...
What can I say? You inspire me.
âJames takes your hand and steers you to a booth, where a student volunteer fills a paper bag with steaming chestnuts and hands them over.
Yum! Thanks!
KJames takes a chestnut and eats it while you cup your hands around the bag.
Mmmm, so warm...
/You know they make gloves for this very reason.
OYeah, but gloves will be hard to put on since I'm never letting go of this bag.
*Does it always snow like this at Hartfeld?
TPretty much. And we're due for even more in the next month. Think you can handle it?
Well...
Of course! I love snow!
&No. Do you think humans can hibernate?
%Sledding, snow angels, ice skating...
/If it's got anything to do with snow, I'm down.
So bring it, winter!
8I'm pretty sure we can't, but I'm not going to stop you.
*You could always hibernate <i>with</i> me.
"Think about it... you, me, a cave?
EJames laughs and puts an arm around your shoulder, hugging you close.
I missed you.
/I missed <i>you</i>. Did you have a nice break?
/That weekend in Northbridge with you was great.
6It was good for me, too, but I meant with your family.
*It was about as nice as could be expected.
Uh-oh. What does that mean?
`My parents are very social. They try to fill the calendar as much as they can over the holidays.
{One day it's the company Christmas party, the next it's ice skating at the lake, and of course, there's the sleigh rides...
6Sleigh rides? Like 'in a one-horse open sleigh' rides?
3Technically, it's a <i>two</i>-horse open sleigh...
?<i>Well</i> then. Sounds very festive. But you didn't enjoy it?
âI liked catching up with friends, but... things between my father and me are still strained since he found out about my writing career...
4Is he hassling you about switching back to business?
?No. I'd almost prefer that to the cold shoulder he's giving me.
àI knew we wouldn't see eye-to-eye on this, but I was hoping... well, I suppose I'll have to redouble my efforts on my play this quarter.
How was your break?
JMy dad still hasn't found a job, so it's a little weird at home right now.
He squeezes your hand.
oSorry to hear that. There'll probably be more opportunities in the new year after the holiday rush dies down...
pYeah, that's what we're hoping for. He's optimistic anyway. And really, winter break was nice, despite all that.
,We don't have sleigh rides, but we always...
Throw an ugly sweater party.
Bake a bunch of cookies.
Build a snowman.
JOh man, my aunt wore this crazy outrageous sweater with blinking lights...
NImagine if you combined printed reindeer vintage wallpaper on 80s shag carpet.
*...I think I have to see it to believe it.
$Maybe I'll wear it on our next date.

Please do.
FIt's kind of a big deal in our house. We turn it into a competition...
Oh yeah? Who won this year?
>You're looking at the household champion, three years running.
LI didn't know I was in the presence of greatness. What's your secret recipe?
I make a mean snickerdoodle.
4I'm surprised you can say that with a straight face.
SOnly because it's the truth. If you're really good, maybe I'll bake some for you...

Please do.
]We have this tradition that on the first snow day of winter break, we wake up really early...
pWe all put on our snow gear and go outside and make a bunch of snowmen, as many as we can until we get too cold.
2I don't really remember how it got started, but...
NIt doesn't feel like 'winter' until we build the first snowfamily of the year.
That's sweet...
mMy family doesn't have anything like that... unless you count the day we mail out the family Christmas cards.
.We can build a snowman together if you like...
I would.
MJames reaches over to snatch a chestnut out of the bag, but you hug it close.
.Hey, watch it... You can't eat my handwarmers!
You've got to be kidding me...
:He makes another grab, and you jump off the shoveled path.

How much do you want them?
Hmmm... this much!
íJames dashes after you, and you take off, the two of you throwing up snow as you race. You head into a thicket of trees as James lunges for you...
(What do I do?)
Dodge around the tree!
Freeze in place!
Hold still!
1You dodge around the tree, dancing away from him.
Ha!
:You do realize... that the base of a tree's just a circle?
What?
@James pops around the other side, catching you around the waist.
UYou freeze in place, undecided, and James swoops in and catches you around the waist!
Ah!
Got you!
Whoa! Too much!
mYou trip, and the two of you topple over. He wraps his arms around you as you land together in the soft snow.
	You okay?
-Yeah... Thanks for breaking my fall. My hero.
RI do what I can... But I won't object to a reward. What happened to the chestnuts?
;You point at the bag which has tipped over a few feet away.
>I'm fresh out... but I might have something better to offer...
Oh?
QYou turn in his hold, loop your arms around his neck, and press your lips to his.
That is better.
I thought you might like it.
XHe pulls you down against him, kissing you deeply as the snow falls gently around you...
XEventually, you and James find your way back across campus to the literature department.
(Here we are... Ready to go back to work?
3In a minute. There's one last thing I want to do...
]James pulls you close and is about to kiss you when you feel something vibrate in his jacket.
Vasquez?
<He pulls out his phone and grimaces when he sees the screen.
LYep. Looks like we've been missed. Maybe we can continue this later tonight?
Yeah, definitely.
hJames kisses your cheek, and then you both head into Vasquez's office, wondering what he has in store...
