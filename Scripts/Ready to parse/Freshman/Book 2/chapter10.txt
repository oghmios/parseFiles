Chapter Ten: Ballot Boxing
The Freshman
BG_INT_THEATER_NIGHT
oEarly the next morning, the wind howls as you and your roommates head to the auditorium to hear Chris's speech.
VAs you walk, you and Kaitlyn tell everyone about Sebastian's visit the night before...
Abbie
oI knew Sebastian would play dirty, but I thought he'd have the decency to wait until the race actually started.
	SURPRISED
Zack
RWell, if he thinks Chris can be so easily defeated, he's got another thing coming!
ANGRY
Twombly
{Good morning, everyone, and welcome. We have two fine young men here today announcing their candidacy for school president.
MYou and your friends quickly quiet down and turn your attention to the stage.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_FUN_CHILL
óRemember, neither students' name will appear on the ballot unless they are able to gather <blueberry>100 signatures</blueberry> from students like you.
%Up first, we have Christopher Powell.
HAPPY
Chris
yStudents of Hartfeld, I'm here today because I believe everybody deserves the opportunity to receive a quality education.
pEvery year, hundreds of students are accepted into Hartfeld who are unable to attend due to high tuition prices.
RIf I am elected school president, I will do everything in my power to change that.
5Hartfeld isn't just a school to me. It's a community.
tI hope you will join me in my mission to open our community up to all, regardless of financial situation. Thank you.
BThe audience cheers as Chris takes his seat. Kaitlyn turns to you.
Kaitlyn
What do you think, {You}?
I thought Chris's speech was...
NEUTRAL
Awesome!
Not the best.
Idealist
9You think Chris has what it takes to be school president.
EChris has clearly thought this through. He'll make a great president.
I totally agree!
Cynic
;You're not sure Chris's campaign strategy is the right one.
`Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see more scholarships, but are the rich kids here going to care?
SAD
I hope I'm wrong.
Me too.
=Thank you, Christopher. Up next, we have Sebastian Delacroix.
Oh boy.
lSeveral students cheer as Sebastian walks up to the podium. You hear one voice in particular above the rest.
Becca
Go get 'em, sweetheart!
Ew.
	Sebastian
vStudents, when you think 'Hartfeld University,' do you picture mediocrity? Because that's where this school is headed.
dFor the past few years, our once-exceptional university has been falling further and further behind.
kDo you know why? It's because Hartfeld University has been squandering its funds on frivolous scholarships!
kFor example, all a football player has to do to receive a full-ride scholarship here is maintain a 2.5 GPA!
#Sebastian gives Chris a dirty look.
qIf I'm elected president, we will instead use that money to rebuild Hartfeld's reputation for academic greatness.
Who's with me?
`Several audience members cheer as Sebastian takes a seat, and Ms. Twombly wraps up the assembly.

I think I'm gonna be sick.
That makes two of us.
Tyler
qI wouldn't worry too much. Hartfeld students are smart. It should be easy to see that Chris made the better case.
+What do you think about all of this, {You}?
I'm feeling...
Happy for Chris!
Angry at Sebastian.
Seriously turned on.
*Tyler is right. Chris has this in the bag.
4I'm going to go over and congratulate him right now.
;You might want to tone down the enthusiasm a bit, sunshine.
GKaitlyn points to the front of the auditorium, where Chris is standing.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_LOVE_SAD
...
Right.
I'll go talk to him.
6How dare he shame Chris for being here on scholarship?
ENewsflash, not all of us can have mommy and daddy pay for everything!
/What a jerk! Just look what he's done to Chris.
GKaitlyn points to the front of the auditorium, where Chris is standing.
...
Oh man.

I'd better go talk to him.
9Tyler's right. Chris is definitely going to be president.

.Your relationship with Chris will be affected.

\Okay, Jackie, I hate to break it to you, but your Kennedy isn't looking too happy right now.
GKaitlyn points to the front of the auditorium, where Chris is standing.

I'd better go talk to him.
eYou do that. We should head back and start on the cupcakes for the campaign bake sale this afternoon.
$Awesome. I'll be back to help later.
:As the students file out, you make your way over to Chris.
Hey there. Walk with me?
Chris nods.
BG_EXT_CAMPUS_QUAD_WINTER_DAY
iYou take a walk around the quad, where it seems that the wind has died down, at least for the time being.
lFor what it's worth, we all agreed that Sebastian shaming you for your athletic scholarship was out of line.
wThanks, but that's not what's bothering me. People always complain that athletes get special treatment; I'm used to it.
So then what's bothering you?
You take Chris's hand.
NI'm not sure I can actually do this. 100 signatures by tomorrow? That's a lot.
)Really? That's what you're worried about?
lSure, the first five will be easy; I've got you and our roommates, but where am I going to get the other 95?
Chris...
You have plenty of friends!
You can't just back out now.
HWhat about the football team? They're your guys. Of course they'll sign.
Okay, fair.
OAnd then there's the cast from James's play. I'm sure they'll sign for you too!
(And, James, of course. I bet he'll sign.
And then there's--
Okay! Okay! I get the picture.
$You're right. I can totally do this.
Cheerleader
2You reminded Chris of all the people who love him.
>Do you think Abraham Lincoln had an easy time getting elected?
{You}, I don't think--
UNo, he didn't. It was a crazy election. I just read about it for Intro to US History.
hBut what do you think would have happened if Lincoln had backed out the first time he faced a challenge?
What would have happened?
;Bad things, Chris. So, you <i>cannot</i> let Sebastian win!
Okay, okay! I get it.
I'll get those 100 signatures.
You bet you will.
Feisty
+You gave Chris some much-needed tough love.
hAnd we've got the bake sale this afternoon. I'm sure we'll have plenty of customers who'll want to sign.
That's true.
AHey, {You}? Thanks for talking some sense into me. I needed that.
	Any time.
TJust then, the wind picks back up. You shiver as cold air seeps through your jacket.
Cold?
iChris pulls you into a tight embrace. Your teeth stop chattering as his body heat warms you to your core.
*Wow, you really are a furnace, aren't you?
6Just one of the many perks of dating a man from Maine.
IAnother gust of wind blows by, sending you into another round of shivers.
%We should probably get inside soon...
cYeah, I can hold you just as well indoors as out. But, first, can you help me with one other thing?
$I do have one other concern, though.
What is it?
ZSebastian looks so much more, well, presidential than I do. Would you mind helping me out?
)Are you asking me to give you a makeover?
!Would you judge me if I said yes?
Chris...
Of course I'll do it!
chris_makeover
+I promised Zack I'd help with the cupcakes.
qCome on. This will be fun! We have to be fast though, Zack will <i>kill</i> me if I don't help with the cupcakes.

{You}, you're a lifesaver.

Maybe some other time?
<Sure. As long as it's some time before I win the presidency.
That's the spirit!

UYou and Chris return to your suite to find the kitchen covered in unfrosted cupcakes.
nWhere the hell have you been? Chris, you said that we were going to work on your debate speech this afternoon!
?Sorry, we were shopping for a more presidential look for Chris.
ZI can't be too mad. You look <i>amazing</i>. Who knew the quarterback had such good taste?
]Thanks! But {You} deserves all the credit here. I could have never picked this out on my own.
@Sorry, time kinda got away from us. How are the cupcakes coming?
JJust then, there's a knock at the door. Kaitlyn and Chris go to answer it.

James?
James
gHey. I was wondering if you needed a speech writer. You know, as a thank you for helping with the play?
QYou shoot Kaitlyn and Chris a desperate look. Kaitlyn sees it and turns to James.
FWow, James, that's very nice of you, but as Chris's campaign manager--
tThank you! Welcome aboard! Kaitlyn and I were just getting started prepping for the debate. Think you could help us?
Sure.
IThe three of them pass by you on their way to the roof. You pull aside...
Who do you pull aside?

Kaitlyn
James
Chris, a word?
Okay.
$You guys go ahead, I'll be a minute.
BG_INT_DORM_BEDROOM_DAY
You pull Chris into your room.

What are you <i>doing</i>?
Accepting help?
2Did you forget that he totally hates me right now?
OI know, but I need all the help I can get. And James is the best writer I know!
?I get it, but what if he's doing this to try to get back at me?
(Do you really think James would do that?
XLook, I'll keep an eye out for any suspicious behavior. Would that make you feel better?
It would. Thank you.
0Chris wraps you in his arms and holds you close.
%It's gonna be okay, {You}. I promise.

I guess...
"Chris pulls away and looks at you.
'I mean it. It's going to be fine. Okay?
%Okay, okay. Go work on your campaign.
PChris kisses you softly on the forehead and goes to join the others on the roof.
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
EChris gives you a friendly hug before joining the others on the roof.
!<i>Hey, Kaitlyn. Can we talk?</i>
#Go on, guys. I'll be just a minute.
FYou pull Kaitlyn into your room while James follows Chris to the roof.
!I'm guessing this is about James?
=Yeah. I'm basically one wrong move away from a disaster here.
4I tried to get him out of here but Chris let him in!
1I appreciate it. That's why I called you in here.
.What if James is doing this to get back at me?
ZSay no more. If I see him try anything, he's out, no matter how desperate Chris is to win.
/You pull Kaitlyn into a quick kiss on the lips.
You're the best.
'At kissing or at saving you from jerks?
Yes.
Good answer.
You're the best.
I really am.
GNow I'd better get out there before the boys start wondering what's up.
&<i>James, can I ask you something?</i>
<i>What is it?</i>
!<i>Can we go somewhere more--</i>
James, are you coming?
(I'll be just a minute. Go on without me.
Okay, then. We'll be waiting.
AYou pull James into your room while the others go up to the roof.
You wanted to ask me something?
James...
'Does this mean you're ready to make up?
What are you trying to do here?
)No. I'm not. I wish I was... but I'm not.
dRelationships are supposed to be built on trust, and the secret you kept from me was no small thing.
bFriendships are supposed to be built on trust, and the secret you kept from me was no small thing.
IHow can I ever win back your trust when you're shutting me out like this?
Maybe you can't!
5I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. I just need more time.
0What about the campaign? We both want to help...
cLike I said, I'm here to help Chris. And, unlike some people, when I say something, it's the truth!
James, I...
XWhat? You thought I was here because of you? Typical. It's all about you, {You}. Always.
I'm sorry, that came out wrong.
WI... I can't forgive and forget so easily. I just want to help Chris with his campaign.
But if we both want to help...
9Yeah, I want to help <i>Chris.</i> That's why I'm here...
So, what does that mean for us?
I don't know.
WIt's funny how a total stranger's life can become so completely intertwined with yours.
'But maybe that's not such a good thing.
DWe could try to go back to being... acquaintances, at least for now?
Acquaintances?
$Until I can figure out a few things.
If... if that's what you want.

I think it's for the best.
[You bite your lip and, before you can second-guess it, throw your arms around James's neck.
{You}!
(I know! Just... just for a second, okay?
ZAfter a moment, James's arms snake around your waist, and he holds you close to his chest.

Okay, I'm good now. Sorry.
dYou reluctantly pull away from James. After an awkward pause, he extends his hand, and you shake it.
)James extends his hand, and you shake it.
Acquaintances?
Acquaintances.
yJames gives you a weak smile before he walks out of your room. <pause/>You linger for a moment before you follow him out.
2I just saw that James is here. Is everything okay?
I... think so. Maybe.
eIt's funny. I've been wanting to see him all week. Now that he's here, I kind of wish he would leave.
PWould a cupcake help? I think Chris's campaign can spare one for a worthy cause.
<Abbie hands you a <bubblegum>strawberry cupcake</bubblegum>.
<i>Mmmmm!</i>
I feel better already.

cA few hours later, James has gone home, and your friends have set up for the bake sale on the quad.
&Looks like we have our first customer!
(You spot Edgar stepping out of his dorm.
Hey, Edgar!
Edgar
Uh, hey. What's going on here?
dChris is running for school president, and we're having a bake sale to raise funds for his campaign.
kI'm also collecting signatures to get my name on the ballot. If you sign, your cupcake is 50 cents cheaper.
FFascinating. And why, may I ask, should I support you in this venture?
#You should support Chris because...
He's a huge D&D fan.
)He knows what it's like to be an outcast.
AIs that so? I had no idea! I'm a serious player myself, you know.
What's your alignment, Chris?
Left?
&Edgar storms off without another word.
-{You}, from now on, let's stick to the truth.
Sorry.
jAlthough, for future reference, as school president, if anyone asks about your alignment, say lawful good.
$Yeah, I'll try to keep that in mind.
`He'll stand up for <i>all</i> the students at Hartfeld, not just those who are rich and popular.
mDoes that mean you'll consider registering my Dungeons and Dragons group as an official student organization?
OI'll definitely consider it. I can't promise that the motion will pass, though.
[Edgar immediately signs his name on the sheet, and puts down enough money for two cupcakes.

QChris wants to make Hartfeld a place for <i>everyone</i>, not just the rich kids.

õYou and your friends get a few more signatures over the next hour, but you're still short of your goal when you see Madison come by with a bunch of flyers.
Madison
qHey, you guys! Would you mind putting this flyer up at your booth? It's for a concert on the quad this afternoon.
Sure! Let me look at it.

8No, Madison, because we're campaigning for <i>Chris.</i>
oOoh! So that's why your sign says 'Chris Powell for President.' Well, I hope you'll come to the concert anyway!
Madison skips away, oblivious.
RWell, that's not good. Sebastian is totally trying to draw attention away from us!

<Well, Madison, maybe you should sign Chris's petition, then.

;You'd better be. My shoulder is gonna be bruised for weeks.
-Awwww, want me to kiss it and make it better?
	...Maybe.
XKaitlyn leans in and kisses your shoulder. Then, she presses a gentle kiss to your lips.
What, is my lip bleeding?
'No, that one was just for good measure.
-You take Kaitlyn's hand and continue walking.

BG_INT_FASHION_SHOP
7You and Chris go to Arrows, a trendy store in the mall.
See anything you like?
!Isn't this the girls' department?
JWell, personally, I think this would look <i>very</i> presidential on you.
!You hold up a little black dress.
)I don't think that would look good on me.
IDon't be silly, Chris. Little black dresses look good on <i>everyone!</i>
?Seriously, {You}, I need something <i>sharp.</i> Got any ideas?
A few...
ChrisMakeover
:A few minutes later, Chris steps out of the changing room.
Well, what do you think?
You look...
Very presidential!
Super sexy!
TYou look like you should be sitting in an oval office conducting important business.
ZUnfortunately, this particular presidency doesn't come with an office, but maybe some day.
Relationship Improved
.You and Chris's relationship will be affected.
I know you are, but what am I?
Oh, stop. You look amazing.
Thanks.
He kisses you on the forehead.
You flatter me.
So does that jacket.
0But, more importantly, what do <i>you</i> think?

Chris looks in the mirror.
I think it's perfect.
Perfect.
;You pay for the outfit and make your way to the store exit.
 Could I get a time check, {You}?
It's 12:30.
@Good, we've got a while before we need to get back to the suite.
pI was thinking, since we're here, that I'd treat you to lunch. There's a place I've been meaning to take you to.
I'm in!
!BG_INT_STEAKHOUSE_UPSCALE_NEUTRAL
YAfter lunch, you and Chris share dessert in a cozy corner booth of a gorgeous restaurant.
WMmm. Chris, this place is amazing. Who knew the mall would have a restaurant like this?
1Yeah, but I don't think I could eat another bite.
.The two of you look down at your empty plates.
I guess not.
FYou smile at Chris while a comfortable silence settles over the table.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking...
!I'm so lucky to be here with you.
,I'm proud that you're running for president.
I just really want to kiss you.
rDo you ever think about how crazy it is that, if our lives had gone slightly differently, we might never have met?
!I feel like I've won the lottery.
kRemember the start of the quarter, when you said you didn't know what you wanted to do other than football?
Look at you now.
EI mean, that's pretty much always the case, but especially right now.
Oh, come here, you.
NYou slide over in the booth, and Chris pulls you into a deep, passionate kiss.
#Wow. You are a <i>great</i> kisser.
"It's not like it's the first time.

Some things never get old.

No, they definitely don't.
QChris kisses you again, harder this time, and runs his fingers through your hair.
BYou put your hand on his chest. You can feel his heartbeat racing.
Daniel
A-hem?
Waiter
You both look up.

Your bill?
Waiter
Right.
[Chris hands the waiter his credit card. As he walks away, you and Chris burst out laughing.
/Remind me to give that waiter a huge tip, okay?
,How about 'don't kill the moment next time?'
iShoot, we've gotta get back. Hey, I'm starved. What do you say we pick up some fast food on the way home?
Sounds great to me."
