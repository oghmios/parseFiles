Peter
Hello, {You}.
Grace
We've heard so much about you!
HAPPY
	You have?
	SURPRISED
6Of course! You're practically all Kaitlyn talks about.
Kaitlyn
<i>Mom!</i>
:And, of course, we've heard about the rest of you as well.
Chris

An honor to meet you, sir!
Zack
,I can see where Kaitlyn gets her good looks.
Abbie
>Come on you guys, let's let Kaitlyn catch up with her parents.
Tyler
Good night, Mr. and Mrs. Liao!
MUSIC_COLLEGE_FUN_CHILL
ÅYour suitemates all say their goodnights and head off to their rooms. You're about to leave too when Kaitlyn's mom addresses you.
A{You}, from what we understand, you two have gotten pretty close.
relationships
Uh, yeah, I'd say so.

Kaitlyn throws you a look.
EBut yeah, me and Kaitlyn have been the best of friends since day one!
SMore like <i>really</i> close. Kaitlyn has been my best friend since our first day!
@I'm happy to hear that she's made such good friends at Hartfeld.
`Speaking of good friends, how is Arjun doing? His father said he was excited about the transfer.
Oh, well...
Arjun is...
NEUTRAL
Doing great!
Not really around a lot.
9It's been really cool having him here. He's a lot of fun.
:That's good to hear. He and Kaitlyn go way back, you know.
He's a good boy. Incredibly smart, too. Did you know he was treasurer of the National Honor Society when he was in high school?
3You say that literally every time he comes up, Dad.
!I didn't know that! Good for him.
@We're happy to hear that you and Arjun still get along famously.
DWe've hung out a few times, but it seems like he's made new friends!
yReally? I'm surprised he hasn't made more of an effort to spend time with Kaitlyn. The two of them go way back, you know.
CWell, he <i>is</i> new here. He probably just wanted to branch out.
EThat's a good point. But I do hope you and Arjun stay close, Kaitlyn.
He's a good boy. Incredibly smart, too. Did you know he was treasurer of the National Honor Society when he was in high school?
3You say that literally every time he comes up, Dad.
$Okay, okay. Dad's going to stop now.
qWe were hoping the three of you would accompany us to see the ballet version of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> tomorrow!
The three of us?
You, Arjun, and {You}.
Me?
MYou look to Kaitlyn for direction. She gives you an almost imperceptible nod.
SOf course! I'd be happy to go to the ballet tomorrow. Thank you for thinking of me.

Wonderful!
Kaitlyn's mother yawns.
\Pardon me. It's been a long day, and these late hours don't agree with us <i>old</i> people.
KI'm just glad I got to see you. We can catch up before the ballet tomorrow?
4We would love nothing more. We've missed you, honey.
I've missed you, too.
[Oh, by the way, we brought some of your things from home for you. They're over by the door.
#We'll see you tomorrow, sweetheart.
fKaitlyn's parents take turns kissing her on the forehead and shaking your hand before finally leaving.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_LOVE
KKaitlyn shuts the door behind them, turns to you, and lets out a huge sigh.
Are you alright, Kaitlyn?
JYeah... I'm glad my parents are here. Just been dealing with a lot lately.
SAD
.Kaitlyn picks up one of the boxes by the door.
Help me carry these to my room?
!BG_INT_DORM_BEDROOM_KAITLYN_NIGHT
8You go to Kaitlyn's room and set the boxes on the floor.
aThanks for agreeing to come to the ballet. There's no way I'll be able to survive it without you.
No problem.
PI kind of got the feeling that your parents are trying to set you up with Arjun.
$Yeah. It wouldn't be the first time.
}And you've got to love their choice of ballets! The irony! You may be a Juliet, but you're not exactly looking for a Romeo...
Aren't <i>you</i> my Romeo?
UI promise not to kill your cousin, if you promise not to take any suspicious potions.
Agreed.
dKaitlyn laughs for a moment before frowning, her brow furrowed. She sighs and flops down on her bed.
What a crazy quarter...
What do you mean?
sI have great friends, I have an <i>amazing</i> girlfriend, I was finally starting to feel like I could be myself...
qI have great friends, I had the starring role in a play, I was finally starting to feel like I could be myself...
?And then all these people from home had to show up and ruin it!
ANGRY
Aw, Kaitlyn...

Come here.
Let me cheer you up!
,You hold Kaitlyn tight as she starts to cry.
qEverything's going to be fine, I promise. I mean, Arjun already knows, and your parents are just visiting, right?
(At this point, what else could go wrong?
{You sit there silently for a minute while Kaitlyn cries on your shoulder. Finally, she pulls away and looks you in the eye.
SYou reach into one of Kaitlyn's boxes of stuff from home and pull out a teddy bear.
Q<i>Don't worry Kaitlyn. Everything's gonna be a-ok! You're my bestest friend.</i>

Teddy Bear
Kaitlyn cracks a small smile.
Thanks, Mr. Bear.
<You know, seeing him now, Mr. Bear is actually pretty scary.
What?
RYou take another look at the bear and realize that it has red eyes and matted fur.
NHoly crap, Kaitlyn, this is the most terrifying stuffed animal I've ever seen.
I know, right? Isn't he cute?
7You both start laughing. After a moment, Kaitlyn sighs.
<One day, my parents are going to find out. I know they will.
qAnd I've tried hundreds of times to imagine what that's going to be like, but I honestly can't. And that's scary.
What if they disown me?
#Do you really think they'd do that?
GI don't know! I don't think so? But the fact that they could scares me.
(You put your hand on Kaitlyn's shoulder.
Hey, we're all here for you.
 Chris, Tyler, Abbie, and Zack...
You kiss Kaitlyn softly.
*And no matter what, you'll always have me.
You squeeze her shoulder.
*And no matter what, you'll always have me.
Thanks, {You}.
She pulls you into a tight hug.
+I don't know how I ever got by without you.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_COMEDY_MISCHIEF
4Kaitlyn gets off the bed and goes to a box of stuff.
5Why don't you just leave all of this stuff for later?
GAre you kidding? It would drive me crazy to just leave it on the floor.
2Plus, there's all kinds of great memories in here!
mYou join Kaitlyn in looking through the box and pull out a pile of books, including a sparkly, scented diary.
!I can't believe they packed that!
You kept a diary?
In middle school I did.
*Oh boy, I hope Mom and Dad didn't read it.
Why? What's in there?
LWant to find out? We can read it together. Could be good for a few laughs...
You'd let me read it?
Yes! This'll be fun.

No, thanks...

Relationship Improved
0You and Kaitlyn's relationship will be affected.
3I can't wait to see what little Kaitlyn had to say.
/Don't tease, {You}, or I won't let you read it!
I can see it now...
VDear diary, it's Kaitlyn. I had spinach stuck in my braces all day and nobody told me!

I never had <i>braces!</i>
9Let's crack this thing open, I'm dying with anticipation.
/I can't do it. I'm already embarrassed for you.
Oh, it's not <i>that</i> bad!
@Kaitlyn grabs the diary from you and starts thumbing through it.
...
...
...
Kaitlyn slams the diary closed.
	That bad?
$Forget I ever brought up reading it.
UDiary? What diary? Let's finish unpacking. We have to get up pretty early tomorrow...
=You help Kaitlyn unpack her things until late into the night.
<And... that's the last of it. Thanks for helping out, {You}.
?Anytime. Now, I'm going to bed before I pass out on your floor.
6You lean over and press your lips to Kaitlyn's softly.
I'll see you in the morning.

BG_INT_DORM_MAIN_DAY
pYou hurriedly finish getting ready and go to join Kaitlyn and Arjun, who are already standing by the front door.
'You spin around to show off your dress.
So? What do you think?
WDamn, girl! I don't think I've ever seen someone get dressed up that nicely, that fast!
You look like a posh socialite.
1Maybe I'll just walk around saying things like...
7You clear your throat and say in your fanciest voice...
M'Oh, yes, I frequent the ballet when I'm not summering in the British Isles.'
That dress is gorgeous!
,And my parents will definitely be impressed.
That's perfect for the ballet!
7I gotta say, Kaitlyn, your girlfriend cleans up nicely.
Relationship Improved
0You and Kaitlyn's relationship will be affected.
7Did you expect any less from someone <i>I'm</i> dating?
;Kaitlyn wasn't kidding about the quality of Hartfeld girls.
0Uh, hello, I'm right about basically everything.
bBut too bad, Arjun, my bestie is off-limits. You're gonna have to find someone else to drool over!
5Plus, you know, I'm kind of already dating someone...
Are we ready to go?
Yep! Let's do this!
BG_INT_TRAIN_COMPARTMENT_DAY

MUSIC_COLLEGE_ACTION_CHILL
^The conversation flows easily on the train, at least, until the topic of last Friday comes up.
`On the bright side, I don't think I'll ever have a first date that's more awkward than that one.
I'm glad you two made up.
GWe had a good talk while <i>someone</i> was snoozing away this morning.
ìThe Liaos called me last night to invite me to the ballet. And I realized, I couldn't let a case of hurt feelings cancel out years of friendship...
XPlus, I probably should have seen it coming. No boy ever seemed good enough for Kaitlyn.
You got that right!
eThe point is, I support you, and I'll do whatever I can to keep this parent visit from getting weird.
mI appreciate it, but considering my parents, I'm expecting it to get pretty awkward before act one even ends.
+Don't worry, me and Arjun are on your team.
BG_EXT_NORTHBRIDGE_DOWNTOWN_DAY
DA short while later, you arrive at the train station in Northbridge.
-Your parents said they'd meet us here, right?
Oh, there they are!
>You point to a nearby bench where Peter and Grace are sitting.
Okay, guys, remember: my parents will try as hard as possible to get me and Arjun together. For obvious reasons, that's not going to happen.
Got it.
You walk up to the bench.
Hi there, Mr. and Mrs. Liao!
(What do I do?)
Shake their hands.
	Hug them.
"You give each of them a quick hug.
Oh! Hello there, {You}.
/Did I forget to mention that {You} is a hugger?
You two have that in common.
0And a shared affinity for pretty dresses, I see.
'You give each of them a firm handshake.
]Such a sturdy grip. Kaitlyn, you could learn a thing or two. This is a job-winning handshake.
;I think I'll be just fine in the job department, thank you!
POf course! But with a handshake like this one, who knows where you could end up.
 Oh, Peter, leave the girl alone.
gJudging by the lovely dresses the two of you have on, I'd say you're destined for a career on a runway.
You like it?
It's beautiful!
xI feel I should mention that {You} got ready in less than ten minutes this morning, and she still looks like a princess.
Aw, you're the sweetest.
uHey, as much as I love talking about pretty dresses, we should head to the theater. The ballet's going to start soon.
You like it?
I do.
9Can you believe she got ready in 10 minutes this morning?
uHey, as much as I love talking about pretty dresses, we should head to the theater. The ballet's going to start soon.
4Should we go inside? The show's going to start soon.
1Ah, brilliant idea, Arjun. Don't want to be late.
uIt's a short walk to the theater and along the way, Kaitlyn catches her parents up on her winter quarter at Hartfeld.
,And the play ended up being a total success!

That's wonderful, darling.
PBut I still think you need more extracurriculars. It'll balance out your resume.
XPlus, it's a great way to find love. Your father and I met in the high school orchestra.
5And you were dating that obnoxious Christopher Doyle.
Are you seeing anyone, {You}?
=I am, actually. You met him last night. Our suitemate, Chris?
9Ah, good for you, {You}. He seemed like a nice young man.
And so handsome, too.
I am, actually.
%You'll have to tell us all about him.
7Maybe I will. Something tells me you'd <i>love</i> him.
*You grin at Kaitlyn. Her cheeks turn pink.
8Oh, you don't want to hear about him. He's so... boring!
Kaitlyn!
I was just... kidding?
,To be honest, Mrs. Liao, I'm not quite sure.
Oh. I'm sorry to hear it...
The boy must be an idiot.

Thanks, Mr. and Mrs. Liao.
?Okay, maybe {You}'s love life isn't the best subject right now?
;Uh, did you all see that news segment on gluten-free diets?
I'm not actually.
Oh?
/I've met some interesting people at Hartfeld...
9But I'm really just focused on school and myself for now.
NInspiring! You have a good head on your shoulders. Your parents must be proud.
@But if <i>I'm</i> not dating someone it's the end of the world?!
#{You} is not our daughter, Kaitlyn.
BG_INT_THEATER_NIGHT
4You arrive at the theater and search for your seats.
]Ah, here we are. According to our tickets, the order is {You}, me, Arjun, Kaitlyn, and Grace.
,Kaitlyn shoots you and Arjun panicked looks.
LActually, I was hoping I'd be able to sit next to Kaitlyn, if that's okay...

Sure! I'll trade with you.
EArjun, there's no need to do that. I'd be happy to switch with {You}.
cArjun opens his mouth to protest, but Grace's stern look makes it clear she's not going to hear it.
WYou all take your seats and Grace and Peter immediately start whispering to each other.
#Well, that could have gone worse...
TYeah. But the day's not over yet. I guarantee there's plenty more awkward to come...
We should...
Just ignore it.
Distract them.
GYou know, like, just change the subject whenever you and Arjun come up.
@{You}, what do you think I've been doing for the past 18 years?!
Oh, yeah, right.
YIf we just keep the conversation going on other topics, you and Arjun will never come up.
That could totally work!
8I'll try to keep the conversation on them and not on us.
$Arjun taps Mr. Liao on the shoulder.
;So, have either of you seen <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> before?
+Oh, yes, it's our all-time favorite ballet.
]We used one of the songs for our wedding processional. I'll point it out when they get to it.
WWe've been telling Kaitlyn she should carry on the tradition. With a nice, smart boy...
Shhhh! It's starting!
PAs the lights go down in the theater, you take Kaitlyn's hand between the seats.
<i>{You}!</i>
#<i>Don't worry, they can't see.</i>
kShe throws a nervous glance toward her parents, who are enraptured by the ballet. Kaitlyn relaxes a little.
}You try to enjoy the ballet, but every time a romantic scene occurs, Mr. Liao glances over at Kaitlyn and Arjun with a smile.
...
...
...
LAs soon as the lights go up for intermission, Kaitlyn jumps out of her seat.
2I need to get some fresh air. {You}, come with me?
	Uh, sure.
jYou follow her lead and give an uncomfortable smile to Mr. and Mrs. Liao as you pass them on your way out.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_LOVE_SAD
HOnce you're out front of the theater, Kaitlyn starts to pace agitatedly.
wI'm starting to get the sense that your dad wants you to <i>marry</i> Arjun. Like, he's already got a venue picked out.
qPfft, I wouldn't be surprised. In high school, I <i>literally</i> caught him praying that Arjun would ask me out.
'She stops pacing and turns to face you.
<i>Twice.</i>
.Yikes. So, this is kind of a long time coming.
Did you ever...
End up dating Arjun?
$Try to tell your parents you're gay?
"You know, like just to try it out.

No, we never dated. But...
Kaitlyn sighs.
 We did kiss once in high school.
Should I be jealous?
HThe corner of Kaitlyn's mouth quirks up in a smile. She takes your hand.
LOf course not, {You}. That's so far in the past it's walking with dinosaurs.
BI <i>knew</i> before I kissed him that I wasn't into him that way.
MAt the time, I thought it might be the only way to make my dad proud of me...
9I'm sure your dad is proud of you... How could he not be?
/You know, like back when you first realized it?
UOf course I did! At least once a day, I thought, 'Okay, Kaitlyn, here's your chance.'
And... ?
<And everytime I thought it was the right time, it never was.
êI just kept thinking that next time I would tell them. And before I knew it, I was away at college and it didn't seem to matter as much anymore.
Until Arjun showed up?
;Kaitlyn takes your hand, a small smile playing on her lips.
Until <i>you</i> showed up.
Me?
oI'd kissed girls before, dated a little bit. But it wasn't until I met you that I knew that I had to tell them.
mBecause as soon as I really got to know you, all I wanted to do was call my mom and tell her how happy I was.
0You smile and squeeze her hand tighter in yours.
LActually, as stupid as it sounds, it started to matter again because of you.
Me?

Kaitlyn smiles sheepishly.
ZI don't know if you know this, but I kinda had a <i>massive</i> crush on you last quarter.
 Yeah... kinda picked up on that.
ÇOh whatever, that's in the past. But when I really got to know you, all I wanted to do was call my mom and tell her all about you.
It's all so frustrating!
&<i>Why</i> is it so hard to tell them?
xOne day, you will. And when you do, I promise everything will be fine. And I will be here for you every step of the way.
But until then...
?You use your intertwined hands to pull her body close to yours.
3Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?
)Kaitlyn grins and leans in closer to you.
 I can think of a thing or two...
Kaitlyn presses her lips against yours, kissing you deeply. After a minute, you pull away, breathless. Kaitlyn rests her head against yours.
(I wish I could just tell them about you.
XI know it's hard, especially since they're in town, but it's not something you can rush.
Wouldn't that be nice?
They're my parents.
)Kaitlyn's voice rises in her frustration.
OI just want to shake them and shout <i>'I'm gay!'</i> and have it be done with!
.You glance over Kaitlyn's shoulder and freeze.
Uh... maybe you don't have to.

K-Kaitlyn?
MUSIC_COLLEGE_TENSE_SAD
`Kaitlyn turns around and finds herself face to face with her parents. Her father looks stricken.
+Mom? Dad? I was just... {You} and I were...
WShe trails off uselessly. There's an uneasy pause as you all wait for someone to speak.
I...
5We should go inside. The second act's about to begin.
jHe turns and stalks away quickly. Kaitlyn's mom tries to stop him, but he shrugs her off and walks inside.
 Oh no. This is <i>all</i> wrong.

Kaitlyn...
dBefore you can do anything to comfort her, Kaitlyn's mom walks over and wraps Kaitlyn in a warm hug.
Mom? You're not mad?
MMad? No, honey, of course not. Your dad's just a little... late to the party.
Mrs. Liao...
Did you know...
About Kaitlyn?
All this time?
I mean, did you know she...
Likes girls?
LKaitlyn looks up at her mother's face. Grace smiles sweetly down at Kaitlyn.
Did you?
JOf course, baobei. My only daughter? I'd have to be blind not to see it...
Have you always known?
I've had my suspicions...
BAnd you never said anything because you didn't want it to be true.

Stop that.
6I never said anything because you never said anything!
And Dad?
FMrs. Liao pauses, stroking Kaitlyn's hair gently. Finally, she speaks.
He just needs some time.
He hates me, doesn't he?
2Never! You know how your father is about family...
ZYou're our only daughter. Your father had dreams for you, and a lot of dreams for himself.
MDreams of a white wedding and grandchildren. A dream he may never get to see.
But...
"What about what Kaitlyn dreams of?
!That dream could still come true!
!Doesn't that count for something?
?Of course it does! Why do you think we sent her to this school?
,Kaitlyn can still get married and have kids!
Ahem, if I want to.
QI know this sounds cliche... but you'll understand when you're a parent yourself.
gMrs. Liao releases Kaitlyn, but keeps a firm grip on her shoulders. She looks Kaitlyn right in the eye.
8We will <i>always</i> love you, Kaitlyn. No matter what.

But Dad...
YYour dad won't be upset about this forever, trust me. He just needs some space right now.
PKaitlyn bites her lip for a moment. Then, she nods. Her mom pats her arm gently.
;Alright. We should get back in there before act two starts.
7Actually, I think I'm just gonna head back to Hartfeld.
Are you sure?
=You can stay if you want, I just... I can't go back in there.
9She gives her mother a quick hug and a kiss on the cheek.
9Can you tell Arjun that I got a stomachache or something?

Kaitlyn...
JKaitlyn untangles herself from her mother's grasp and starts to back away.
I just can't.
&You and Grace watch Kaitlyn walk away.
HUh, I think I should go, too. Thanks for the... lovely outing Mrs. Liao.
Don't mention it...
You turn to head after Kaitlyn.
Oh! And, {You}?
"You stop and turn back toward her.
$Take care of my daughter, would you?

Of course.

You run off after Kaitlyn.
Kaitlyn! Wait up!
pKaitlyn doesn't turn but her pace slows to let you catch up. You fall into an uncomfortable silence as you walk.
So...
That was interesting...
Are you okay?
7I'm guessing that probably didn't go like you imagined.
...
%You should trust your mom. Your dad--
"I know that's a stupid question...
...
%Of course you're not okay. Your dad--
{You}!
QKaitlyn stops in her tracks and turns to glare at you. After a moment, she sighs.
6It's just... too soon. Can we just not talk right now?
Sorry. Whatever you need...
rYou reach out to try and take Kaitlyn's hand, but she shrugs you off and keeps walking toward the train station...
eYou wait for Kaitlyn to say more, but she just turns and heads toward the train station in silence...
lAfter a long, silent train ride, you arrive back at your suite. Kaitlyn turns and goes straight to her room.
E<i>Yikes.</i> Is anyone cold? It feels like an icy wind just blew in.
^From down the hall, you hear Kaitlyn's door slam, and you plop down on the couch next to Zack.
+It's <i>really</i> not the time for joking.
DSerious mode, got it. What happened? Was the ballet <i>that</i> bad?
6The first half was fine. We left in kind of a hurry...
6After Kaitlyn... accidentally came out to her parents.
<jiggle>WHAT?!</jiggle>
*How does one <i>accidentally</i> come out?
0You fill Zack in on the events of the afternoon.
-And then we just sat on the train in silence.
'Well, don't just sit out here and hide!
What?
-She's your girlfriend, dummy. Go talk to her!
.She's your best friend, dummy. Go talk to her!
	I'll try.
"Maybe the second time's the charm.
5You get off the couch and go knock on Kaitlyn's door.
Go away!
Kaitlyn
Kaitlyn, it's me...
I'm coming in.
I'm not leaving.
TYou open the door and peek inside. Kaitlyn is sitting on her bed, hugging her knees.
9Is it too much to ask for a little privacy in this place?
_You lean against the door and start humming, loudly. After a few moments, the door swings open.
Seriously, {You}?
QYou squeeze past her and go sit on her bed. She plops down next to you in a huff.
*What part of go away don't you understand?
NThe part where my girlfriend is upset and doesn't want to talk to me about it.
OThe part where my best friend is upset and doesn't want to talk to me about it.
XKaitlyn groans and falls back against her pillows. She rolls over so her back is to you.
FPlease, Kaitlyn. I'm so sorry your parents had to find out that way...
I just want to be here for you.
"I'm really not in the mood, {You}.
eDid you see the way my dad looked at me? It was like I was a stranger. Like he didn't even know me...
Aw, come on, Kaitlyn.
>You lay down in the bed next to her and put an arm around her.
RHowever you're feeling, whatever you're thinking about... You can tell me, always.
You know what, {You}?
BShe sits up, shrugging her arm off of you and turning to face you.
WYou seem to be having a real listening problem today, so let me spell this out for you.
=<pause/>I<pause/> don't<pause/> want<pause/> to<pause/> talk.
$Sorry! I wasn't trying to be pushy--
But you <i>are.</i>
,<pause/>Look, I'm sorry for snapping at you.
1But when I said I didn't want to talk I meant it.
?Okay. No talking. So what can I do to take your mind off of it?
SNothing. I don't want to take my mind off of it. And I don't want to talk about it.
&I just want to be alone for a while...

Kaitlyn...
How long is a while?
Are you breaking up with me?
Kaitlyn shakes her head sadly.
EI don't know. But... I think we should put things on pause for a bit.
Things? What things?
Us things. Our relationship...
BI need time to process this. I need time to figure out what to do.
KAnd I just don't think I can do that while I'm worried about upsetting you.
After all we've been through?
TAnd now, we can finally be together without worrying about Arjun and your parents...
And you're going to end it?
#Kaitlyn puts her head in her hands.
Kaitlyn, answer the question.
Are you breaking up with me?
PKaitlyn doesn't meet your eye. She picks at the edges of the blanket on her bed.
I don't know.
YYou lay down on the bed next to her and stare up at the ceiling. She doesn't move at all.
PYou're my best friend, and there's nothing you could say that would change that.
Please, just say something.
3You know what, {You}? I do have something to say...
;She sits up abruptly and spins to face you. You sit up too.
AAnd since you're hard of hearing I'll say it really slow for you.
=<pause/>I<pause/> don't<pause/> want<pause/> to<pause/> talk.
But--
No, no but's.
FLook, I don't mean to snap at you. But I just really need to be alone.
:And yeah, you are my best friend. But given our history...
HI just don't think you're the best person for me to be around right now.
But Kaitlyn...
Please. Just... just leave.
"Kaitlyn lies down again, facedown.
I...
TBut instead of finishing your thought, you give Kaitlyn her wish and leave the room.
Hey, {You}... Everything okay?
Right now? No.
Do you want to talk about it?
You shake your head.
BNot really. Besides, you've got your hands full with the campaign.
kYou can say that again. You're okay to help me practice debating tomorrow, right? We can always postpone...
%Of course. I'll be fine. Don't worry.
eCan you and Kaitlyn patch things up? And how will Chris fare in the debate? Keep playing to find out!
ÉYou sit down on Kaitlyn's bed, and she plops down next to you. She peers over your shoulder as you open the diary to a random page.
9I hope there's nothing <i>too</i> embarrassing in here...
We're about to find out.
r<i>Dear Diary,

Dad rented this lame old movie for us to watch tonight. I think it's part of his sports thing.</i>
Kaitlyn's Diary
Q<i>Yesterday, he took me to the tennis courts, which I'm AWFUL at by the way.</i>
Kaitlyn's Diary
M<i>Now, we have to watch some dumb soccer movie with an even dumber name.</i>
Kaitlyn's Diary
V<i>Seriously.</i> Bend it Like Beckham? <i>What do you even</i> bend <i>in soccer?</i>
Kaitlyn's Diary
A<i>Ugh, he's calling me downstairs. Gotta go.

Love,
Kaitlyn.</i>
Kaitlyn's Diary
tOh, man, I was <i>such</i> a whiner. And dumb, too. <i>Bend It Like Beckham</i> is, like, one of my favorite movies.

You turn to the next page.
J<i>Dear Diary,

</i>Bend it Like Beckham <i>is my new favorite movie!!</i>
Kaitlyn's Diary
I<i>Dad wants to sign me up for soccer... I guess I'll give it a shot.</i>
Kaitlyn's Diary
Y<i>They make it look really fun in the movie, and it'll probably get Dad off my case.</i>
Kaitlyn's Diary
So, your dad...
Is a big sports guy?
Was on your case a lot?
Hmm... I don't think so.
Then why all the sports stuff?
^I was kind of an awkward kid... I think he thought joining a sport would help me make friends.

And I guess, he was right.
/Kind of. I mean, I knew that my dad loved me...
I was just kind of a loner.
<He thought a sport would break me out of my shell, you know?
'Yeah, I get that. Did it actually work?

Sort of...
You flip through a few pages.
6Oh! First day of soccer practice, this should be good.
I<i>Dear Diary,

I had my first soccer practice today, and guess what?</i>
Kaitlyn's Diary
z<i>Soccer sucks! I got kicked in the shin, like, six times. Plus, Dad wouldn't leave even though it was just practice.</i>
Kaitlyn's Diary
l<i>He seemed really happy though. And I made a friend! Her name's Mira, and she likes horror movies too!</i>
Kaitlyn's Diary
V<i>She invited me over for a slumber party this weekend. I hope my parents let me.</i>
Kaitlyn's Diary
<Kaitlyn bites her lip and shuffles uncomfortably on the bed.
	You okay?
*Yeah... It's just, I know what comes next.
Oh, well, should we stop?
...No, it's fine. Keep going.
Okay...
BYou turn to the next page, take a deep breath, and keep reading...
q<i>Dear Diary,

last night was... weird. It started out okay. Mira's mom made cookies and we watched a movie.</i>
Kaitlyn's Diary
k<i>After her parents went to sleep, though, we played Truth or Dare. I dared Mira to kiss me as a joke.</i>
Kaitlyn's Diary
\<i>Only, she actually did it! It was really fast. But... I can't stop thinking about it.</i>
Kaitlyn's Diary
"<i>Is something wrong with me?</i>
Kaitlyn's Diary
^You notice that Kaitlyn is no longer peering over your shoulder but staring up at the ceiling.
Was that...
When you realized it?
Your first girlfriend?
That you liked girls?
+Well, not all at once, but basically, yeah.
[I remember it like it was yesterday. It was like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders...
(...and then dropped right onto my chest.
Should I be jealous?
Of course not.
9Mira was my first crush, but she was never my girlfriend.
#We just became really good friends.
[I think she knew that I had a crush on her, but I was embarrassed so I never said anything.
9Well, look at you now. You've come a long way since then.
Yeah. Yeah I have.
IKaitlyn takes the diary from your hands and sticks it up on a high shelf.
FNow, let's stop reading this before you get to my 13th birthday party.

What?! Give me that diary!
;Nope. The moment's passed. Now, come on, help me finish up!"
