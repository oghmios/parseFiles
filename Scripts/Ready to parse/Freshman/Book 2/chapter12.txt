Chapter Twelve: The Debate
The Freshman
BG_INT_DORM_BEDROOM_DAY
kAfter a long week of classes and campaigning, it's finally the day of the student body presidential debate!
Kaitlyn
You5
FYou leave your dorm bright and early to meet Chris at the coffee shop.
BG_INT_COFFEE_SHOP_WINTER_DAY
Chris
ÜThanks for agreeing to help me out last-minute, {You}. Kaitlyn is still pretty upset about what happened, so I'm letting her sleep in.
No problem. Is she doing okay?
SAD
MUSIC_COLLEGE_LOVE_SAD
sI know she called her mom and talked things over, but she still seems unhappy. I take it you're still not speaking?
You nod.
It's...
Very frustrating.
 Okay. She needs space right now.
relationships
,I mean, she is my girlfriend... <pause/>Was.
DActually, I'm not even sure. She wouldn't give me a straight answer.
ANGRY
-I mean, she is my best friend... <pause/>Was.
*What if this is the end of our friendship?
HI thought that when something went wrong, we'd be able to talk about it.
I guess not.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Thanks for letting me vent.
=Accidentally being outed to your parents? That's a nightmare.
_I can't even imagine what it would be like to be so completely exposed to my parents like that.
gIf the best way for Kaitlyn to deal with it is for me to step out of the picture for a while, so be it.
&Wow, {You}, that's very mature of you.
5Yeah well... I hope things work out soon. I miss her.
Thanks for listening, Chris.
Any time, {You}
5He takes your hand, lacing his fingers between yours.
KDo you think I'm being a good friend to Kaitlyn? Because I'm not sure I am.
DOf course you are, {You}. You wouldn't be so worried if you weren't.
	SURPRISED
)I guess I didn't think about it that way.
hYou mean you don't naturally assume being sad makes you a good person? Glad you've got me to remind you.
HAPPY
PChris kisses you softly, lingering for just a moment. You grin as he pulls away.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_COMEDY_MISCHIEF
%Now there's that smile I'm crazy for.
ZThanks. Now can we stop this before you make me blush? You've got a debate this afternoon!
8No problem. I'm sure Kaitlyn will be ready to talk soon.
Thank you. I hope you're right.
,Now, don't you have a debate this afternoon?
You bet I do!
\You seem confident. You're not worried that Sebastian's going to pull any more dirty tricks?
pA little bit, but I've been thinking and I've decided the best thing to do is make a point of not insulting him.
gI'm encouraging people to vote <i>for</i> me, not <i>against</i> him. People want a positive president.
+Good thinking. Now, let's hear that speech!
"Chris grins and clears his throat.
\Students of Hartfeld, I would like to thank you once again for coming to watch this debate--
Darren
(Hey, Chris! Where were you this morning?
AYou turn around to see Darren and Logan coming toward your table.
Guys, what are you doing here?
Logan
jGetting coffee, man. What are <i>you</i> doing here? We were gonna meet at the gym this morning, remember?
<I guess he decided to decided to 'study' with {You} instead.
?Oh, shoot! I'm sorry, guys. It's just, the debate's today and--
 You've gotta get ready. We know.
HWe should make you a shirt. "I can't. I'm running for school president."
Hey!
NEUTRAL
Can I have one too?
That's not funny!
 See? There's a market for these!
rYou think you've got it bad? I went to the movies <i>by myself</i> last weekend while my boyfriend wrote a budget!

Seriously?
LThat was <i>one time!</i> Besides, you wanted to see <i>The Flower Girl</i>.
6You think you've got it bad? Try living with this guy!
What are you talking about?
^I'm talking about your dishes, Chris! It's been five days since you've washed them! Five days!
5Okay, okay, I'm sorry! I'll do them tonight, I swear!
You'd better.
XI'm sure Chris will be at every single practice once football season comes around again.
Yeah, yeah. We know.
;Okay, come on, I don't blow you guys off <i>that</i> often!
Do I?

Logan punches Chris's arm.
Nah, you're good.
.Just buy us all a round when you win, alright?
Chris glances at his watch.
oHey, I realize that I'm doing exactly what you were complaining about, but I've got a mic check in ten minutes.
.That's alright, go ahead! We'll see you later!
8Chris gets up and leaves. Darren and Logan wave goodbye.
EActually, I've got a meeting with Professor Vasquez in a few minutes.
"Is he finally out of the hospital?
_Yeah, thank goodness. But, that does mean I'm back to working at break-neck speed. I should go.
Alright, see you later, {You}!
MUSIC_COLLEGE_TENSE_SAD
BG_INT_OFFICE_PROFESSOR
fThe door to Vasquez's office is shut when you arrive, but you can hear raised voices through the door.
Yasmin
NI don't care who you are! Think of the potential revenue that this can create!
TNot to mention the younger audience your book will reach. Don't you understand that?
Vasquez
2I understand perfectly! That's not the issue here!
(What should I do?)

Interrupt.
Wait outside.
)You swing the door open and march inside.
kExcuse me, Yasmin, but I believe that it's <i>my</i> time to meet with Professor Vasquez, not <i>yours</i>.
;Believe me when I say my time is more important than yours.
GNo, {You} is right. We have a meeting, and <i>you</i> are not involved.
VNow get out of my office this instant or your contract is going in the paper shredder.
DYasmin shoots you a dirty look before leaving. Vasquez turns to you.
UI must admit, as irritating as your stubbornness is, it does come in handy sometimes.
Professor Vasquez...
"Does this mean I'm growing on you?

I just can't stand Yasmin.
Don't let it go to your head.
8She's an agent. It's her job to push for what she wants.
)But no, I don't care for her much either.
?You slump down on a bench outside of Vasquez's office and wait.
üAfter five more minutes of heated discussion, the door slams open and Yasmin storms off in a huff. Vasquez appears in the doorway and sees you sitting outside.
{You}, were you eavesdropping?
bNot intentionally. I was waiting for our meeting and, well, you and Yasmin were being really loud.
I...
...guess you're right.
1Vasquez sighs and motions for you to take a seat.
aI'm sorry you had to hear that. Yasmin doesn't care that I drove my daughter away with that book.
5Renewing that sale may end our relationship for good.
)So, what do you think you're going to do?
TI'm not sure. On one hand, the royalties would help Gabriela immensely after I pass.
RBut, on the other, she hates the book so much I'm not even sure she'd accept them.
That is tough.
You're free to go, by the way.
1You don't want to read what I've written for you?
kJust put it over there. I've been a bit... distracted... this week and haven't been able to write anything.
SWell, maybe you'll find this inspiring. I promise, it's got <i>plenty</i> of drama.
\James told me that you two had a falling out because I asked you to keep my cancer a secret.
We did, and...
I feel terrible.
 He's being totally unreasonable.
fSo do I. It was wrong of me to keep it from him. And I'm sorry that he's chosen to take it out on you.
4He really does care about you. You know that, right?
I'll talk to him. I promise.

Thank you.
Relationship Improved
.Your relationship with James will be affected.
james
DMaybe he is, but please remember that he just learned I have cancer.
eI know that it's mostly my fault for hiding it from him, and I'm sorry that he's taken it out on you.
_But it has only been two weeks. It's going to take more time than that for him to process this.
&Next chance I get, I will talk to him.

Thank you.
Relationship Improved
.Your relationship with James will be affected.
OYou're welcome. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have pressing matters to attend to.
%Right. I'll let you get back to work.
6Right before you exit the room, Vasquez's phone rings.
Hello?
+Okay, okay, I'll be there as soon as I can!
He hangs up.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_ACTION_FUN
mIt's Gabriela! She's in labor! {You}, call James and let him know that I need a ride. He'll want to be there.
brought_james
Professor Vasquez...

I'm on it!

#I think I'd better just call a cab.
'You pull out your phone and call James.
BG_EXT_CAMPUS_PARK_WINTER_DAY
James
!Hi, {You}. Is everything alright?
BJames! Vasquez wanted me to call... Gabriela just went into labor!
"{You}, I... <pause/>I'm on my way!
BG_INT_HOSPITAL_WAITING_NIGHT
ÅOne speedy car ride later, you and James sit on opposite sides of the waiting room while Vasquez goes in to be with his daughter.
...
...
GAfter several minutes, the awkward silence is finally interrupted by...
7Do whatever. We need to get to the hospital <i>now!</i>
4You pull out your phone and dial as fast as you can.
RHello? Taxi? I need a ride for two from Hartfeld University to the hospital, ASAP!
BOne speedy cab ride later, you and Vasquez arrive at the hospital.
YWhile Vasquez goes in to be with his daughter, you take a seat in the empty waiting room.
3Just as you're starting to fall asleep, in walks...
Madison?
What are you doing here?
Madison
^Volunteering! Kappa requires its sisters to do twenty hours of community service each quarter.
/What about you? What are <i>you</i> doing here?
&Oh my gosh... Are you <i>pregnant?</i>
fooled_madison
	Pregnant?
	What? No!
Yes. Yes I am.
[Professor Vasquez's daughter is having her baby and he needed help getting to the hospital!
Oh...
'What made you think {You} was pregnant?
#What made you think I was pregnant?
FWell... Becca said the other day that she thought you'd gained weight.
Rude!
`Yeah, I didn't see it, but when I saw you here, I thought the weight might be because of a baby.
Oh my gosh! I knew it!

Are you the father, James?
Uh, yes?
TI can't believe it! With parents like you two, this baby is gonna be <i>so cute!</i>
Who's the father? Is it Chris?
IUh, yes. I'm definitely having a baby and Chris is definitely the father.
TI can't believe it! With parents like you two, this baby is gonna be <i>so cute!</i>
 Who's the father? Is it Kaitlyn?
'Uh, Madison, that's not biologically...
3I mean, yes, yes, Kaitlyn is definitely the father.
TI can't believe it! With parents like you two, this baby is gonna be <i>so cute!</i>
Who's the father? Is it James?
IUh, yes. I'm definitely having a baby and James is definitely the father.
TI can't believe it! With parents like you two, this baby is gonna be <i>so cute!</i>
2Is it a girl or a boy? What are you gonna name it?
;If it's a girl, can you name it Macy? I love the name Macy!
9Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down! I'm not due until September!
OJust so you know, it's kind of a secret right now, so please don't tell anyone!
8Don't worry, I'm really, really good at keeping secrets!
:Oh my gosh, I'm so excited! You're gonna be a great mommy!
vJust then, the door to the maternity ward opens and a nurse wheels out Gabriela and her new son. Vasquez is with them.
#{You}, James, meet my new grandson!
{You}, meet my new grandson!
J<i>Your</i> grandson? Does this mean that Vasquez is your father? Ohmygod!
Gabriela
What?
LMadison, of course Vasquez isn't my father. I'm not pregnant. It was a joke!
It was? Oh.
@Madison looks thoughtful for a second, then bursts out laughing.
Oh, you got me good, {You}!
9Professor Vasquez, you didn't tell me you had a daughter!
Nobody responds at first.
Yes, well...
<I don't talk about my personal life with students very much.
"Madison! It's time to get to work!
Nurse
,I guess I've gotta go. Good seeing you guys!
@Madison skips off, leaving everyone in an uncomfortable silence.
Baby
<jiggle>Waaaaah!</jiggle>
What do I do?
Have you tried...
Tickling him?
Singing to him?
MUSIC_COLLEGE_LOVE
*Gabriela lightly tickles the baby's tummy.
Who's a good baby?
)The baby coos. Gabriela blows him a kiss.
You're a good baby!

)The baby coos. Gabriela blows him a kiss.
You're a good baby!
...

It worked!
I don't... I can't sing!
FThe baby cries harder. Gabriela starts to sing in a low, creaky voice.
2<i>A la nanita nana, nanita ella, nanita ella.</i>
DVasquez joins in, his voice deep and calming. The baby stops crying.
4<i>Mi nin tiene sueno, bendito sea, bendito sea.</i>
BYour mother and I used to sing you that song when you were a baby.
I remember.
fYou notice James smiling at you for the first time in weeks. Your heart leaps, but then he turns away.
%Vasquez gives the baby another smile.
Hey there, little baby.
0The baby reaches out and grabs Vasquez's finger.
Do you want to hold him?
N<pause/>No. That's alright. This has been nice, but I should get back to work.
(James, {You}, come along. We need to go.
&{You}, call a cab. We'll wait outside.
*Vasquez shuffles off as quickly as he can.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_TENSE_NEW

<jiggle>Waaaaaah!</jiggle>
Oh no...
>I'll go talk to Vasquez while you take care of the baby, okay?
Okay!
!I'll stay here and help Gabriela!
PYou walk quickly after Vasquez, following him through the halls of the hospital.
BG_EXT_TOWN_CENTER_WINTER_DAY
}He keeps his pace clipped until he is outside of the hospital, where he finally slows and drops onto a bench by the entrance.
Professor Vasquez?
{You}? Where's James?
;He's inside with Gabriela. I came outside to talk with you.
RThere you are, {You}. How long did they say it would take for the cab to get here?
3I didn't call one. I came outside to talk with you.
Why did you run off like that?
I have <i>cancer</i>, {You}!

I'm sorry.
And I'm guessing that...
You're scared to get attached.
You wish you had more time.
&I can't imagine how hard that must be.
DWhen I first got the diagnosis, I wasn't worried about being missed.
YMy wife died years ago, my only child hated me, and all my friends are estranged or dead.
(Now, suddenly, I have a grandson, and...
You love him?
Yes! And I-- I don't want...
)You don't want to be taken away from him.

Precisely.
&I can't imagine how hard that must be.
sWhen I first got the diagnosis, I was at peace with it, knowing that my writing career would extend beyond my life.
-And now there's something new you want to do?
3Yes. I want... I want to watch my grandson grow up.
Vasquez looks away from you.
Oh, Professor Vasquez.
0Don't look at me like that. Like I'm so pitiful.

Alright, alright! I won't.
6But you really should go in and talk to your daughter.
>Why? What would it accomplish? I burned that bridge years ago.
!You should talk to her because...
You'll feel better.
She'll feel better.
MNobody knows when their last moment will be. We get clues, but we don't know.
gI like to think I'll live a <i>long</i> life, but who knows? I could get hit by a car tomorrow morning.
;But that doesn't mean it isn't worth being happy right now.
FGabriela's been through a lot, and she's got a long road ahead of her.
`Don't you think she deserves to go to sleep at night knowing she and her father have made peace?
xFor once, you may actually be right. I'll talk to her. But I still wish I had something I could give her after I'm gone.

Don't you?
What are you talking about?
?We were talking about it just this morning, don't you remember?
5Vasquez's eyes light up as he realizes what you mean.
SOf course! It might not correct the years of damage done, but maybe it will help...
Let's go talk to my daughter.
cYou return to the waiting room, where James and Gabriela are talking to one of the hospital nurses.
XYou return to the waiting room, where Gabriela is talking to one of the hospital nurses.
You're back!
9Yep! And Professor Vasquez has something he wants to say.
Everybody looks at Vasquez.
WFirst of all, Gabriela, I hope you know that I do regret writing <i>Winter in July</i>.
XPartly because of the rift it created between us, but mostly because of how it hurt you.
RIf I could go back, the book would never exist. I'm very, very sorry that it does.
pSo now I'm going to do what I should have done years ago, Gabriela, and give you back control of your own story.
CWhen I pass on, the rights to <i>Winter in July</i> will go to you.
wYou can keep the book off of the shelves, or sell the rights and live the comfortable life you and my grandson deserve.

I leave the choice to you.
©He takes a deep breath and approaches Gabriela. You see tears forming in her eyes. She hands the baby to the nurse and, without a word, reaches up to embrace her father.
-You look over to see James smirking slightly.
...
KHe quickly stops when he realizes you noticed, and looks away, embarrassed.
{You}, thank you.
3Without you, none of this would have been possible.
It was seriously my pleasure.
8You haven't gotten to hold the baby yet, have you? Here.
Oh...

Thank you!
I'd actually prefer not to.
&Be careful! Newborns are very fragile.
Don't worry. I will be.
The baby
Take the baby from the nurse
QNothing personal, but I'm just a little nervous about holding someone so fragile.
7Would you mind holding him while I talk to him, though?
Of course not!
RGabriela takes the baby back from the nurse. You crouch down so he's at eye level.
$Who's a handsome boy? You are, Mr.--
 Uh, Gabriela... what's his name?
kWell, I <i>thought</i> I was having a girl. So, clearly, Isabella is out of the question. Now I don't know.
HWhat about Santiago? That would have been your name if you'd been a boy.
UOr maybe Atticus? Didn't you say <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> was your favorite book?
eOr maybe Atticus? You loved it when I read <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> to you when you were younger.
GI don't know... He doesn't really look like a Santiago or an Atticus...
What do you think, {You}?

Felix
How about...
Felix
rHmmm... {baby_middle_name}, I do like that. I'll keep it in mind. For now, let's just keep calling him 'the baby.'
aAs much as we're all enjoying your company, {You}, didn't you say your friend had a debate today?

Oh crap! I totally forgot!
AYou pull out your phone to see a slew of texts from your friends.
I've got to run.
KDon't worry about my dad. I'll have one of the nurses call for a cab later.
Best of luck with the debate!
&I expect a full report on how it went!
Kidding, get out of here.
QThanks, you two. I'm so glad I got to be here for this. Now, if you'll excuse me.

6This young man is a mediocre student and party animal.
_If it weren't for his athletic ability, he never would have been allowed to attend this school.
OI don't think that's right, and any student with common sense shouldn't either.
2Students of Hartfeld, I hope you'll choose wisely.

+{You}! I'm glad you made it. What happened?
dProfessor Vasquez... It's a long story. I'll tell you guys later. How did the rest of the debate go?
Too close to call.
kYou saw how Sebastian was tearing into Chris just now? That was basically what he did for the whole debate.
Why am I not surprised?
GThe good news is that Chris was in great form. He stayed very positive.
'We'll have to keep our fingers crossed.
;Anyway, we're having a game night in the suite. Are you in?
 Yeah! Let me go get Chris first.
$Awesome! We'll meet you there, then.

AKaitlyn points from her campaign manager seat without looking up.
He's over there with Sebastian.

IChris and Sebastian both look up at your interruption. Chris looks upset.
<Uh, everyone's getting together for game night tonight and--
'Sounds good. I'll be there in a minute.
Is something wrong?
What? No! I'm fine.
%Oh, Chris, you lie like a politician.
TWhat would your lady friend think if she found out you had a <i>criminal record</i>?
uYou'd better think about my offer. Drop out... or <i>everyone</i> at the school will find out about your sordid past.
QCriminal record? What could Sebastian be talking about? Keep playing to find out!
aYou smile at the baby, and he stares up at you with wide eyes. You look up to see James watching.
Would you like a turn?
I would.
VJames takes the baby in his arms and rocks him slowly. The baby's eyes begin to close.
Such a sweet boy.
:Look at that, he's asleep. He must really like you, James.
.I've been told I have quite a way with babies.
0James carefully hands the baby back to Gabriela.
A{You} and I should be going now. We'll give you some family time.
Let me walk you out.
@You and James stand outside the hospital with Professor Vasquez.
GListen. I know you two have been out of sorts with each other recently.

7You say your goodbyes and start driving back to campus.
So, James, I have to ask...
!What was with that smirk earlier?
Are you glad you came today?
What are you talking about?
nAfter Professor Vasquez announced that he was going to give Gabriela the book rights, I saw you smirking. Why?
	Oh, that?
James laughs.
ÖI was thinking that, if I'd written a scene like that for Professor Vasquez, he would have complained about excessive sentimentality.
Too 'happy kitty bunny pony'?
He's put it on your work, too?
1After a while he started shortening it to 'HKBP'.
0You both laugh hysterically. Then it gets quiet.
Yeah, I am.
vEver since I found out that Vasquez is... ill... it's been strange to talk to him. Like I was supposed to be grieving.
CSeeing him happy today felt like permission for me to be happy too.
That's good to hear.
It gets quiet in the car.
b{You}, I know you're hoping that I'm going to say I'm ready to get back together, but I'm not yet.

So you're still mad at me?
[No, I'm not angry anymore. I forgive you. But I... I'm not sure we're right for each other.
You're not?
pSo I know you're hoping that I'm going to say we should be friends again, but I'm honestly not sure I want that.

So you're still mad at me?
uNo, I'm not angry any more. I forgive you. But I'm not sure we should stay friends. At least, not in the way we were.
You're not?
KI don't know. We've had some bad times, but we've had some good times, too.
$Today certainly reminded me of that.
-I'm sorry I don't have an answer for you yet.
James...
I'll wait as long as you need.
-I'm just glad to hear you're not mad anymore.
Thanks.
&Yeah, I'm sorry for how I treated you.
eFinding out that you've been lied to on top of finding out someone has cancer? It's a lot to process.
I understand.

UJames turns off the car and the two of you step out onto the parking lot by the quad.
