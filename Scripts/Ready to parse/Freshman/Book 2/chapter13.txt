Sebastian...
ANGRY
	Sebastian
POh, you didn't know? I see. Chris has been keeping secrets from <i>everyone.</i>
HAPPY
 Chris, what is he talking about?
Nothing! Er... well--
]Reconsider my earlier offer. Unless you want the whole school to know about your sordid past!
FI'll leave you two to talk. I assume you have <i>a lot</i> to discuss.
-Sebastian saunters away, smirking to himself.
Is it true, Chris?
I...
SAD
(He trails off and doesn't meet your eye.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_TENSE_SAD
I can't believe...
You kept this from me!
You lied to all of us!
You're such a badass!
Why didn't you say anything?
relationships
>I'm your <i>girlfriend!</i> You know you can tell me anything!
MI was going to, eventually! But... I could never seem to find the right time.
'So you decided to keep secrets instead?
&I didn't want you to think less of me.
/We're your friends! How could you not trust us?
FI <i>do</i> trust you. I just didn't want you all to think less of me.
EWho knew you were so wild? Wait! You didn't... kill someone, did you?
?What? No! Do you honestly think I would do something like that?
)I don't know <i>what</i> to think, Chris.
]Please, {You}. This isn't the way I wanted you to find out. Just give me a chance to explain.
0Fine. But you need to tell me <i>everything.</i>
I will. Promise.
=Can we go somewhere a little more private to talk about this?
#How about we head back to the dorm?
INo... I need to get away from everything for a bit. Let's go for a drive.

_Chris drives in silence for a while. You glance over at him, but he keeps his eyes on the road.
You ready to talk?
Chris lets out a long sigh.
I guess so.
3I haven't told you everything about my past, {You}.
8No, you haven't. But now would be a great time to start.
RI guess I thought if I never talked about it, it couldn't come back to haunt me...
{<pause/> I grew up in Maine with my mom and little sister and brother. Money was tight, Mom was working most of the time...
I see...
(It sounds like things were pretty tough.
What about your dad?
'You must have had a lot to worry about.
iI tried to work odd jobs to help make ends meet, but my hands were pretty full looking after my siblings.
ZSometimes I felt like I was missing out on my teen years. I had too many responsibilities.
Was he around much?
jI want to be open with you, {You}. But my dad is a whole other issue. I'm not ready to talk about him yet.
I understand.
qThe point is, I was young and frustrated, and I didn't have a lot of friends. I felt like I was going to explode.
tThere was this group of guys at my school... They cut class a lot, snuck cigarettes during lunch, got into fights...
The troublemakers?
dBig time. Anyway, one day they invited me to come sit with them behind the bleachers during lunch...
....And before long, I was part of their group.
$So you fell in with the wrong crowd.
xIt was great at first. I finally had somewhere to belong, and breaking the rules gave me a thrill I'd never felt before.
=But you can't go on like that without creating more problems.
]I was neglecting my family, falling behind in school, and getting into more and more trouble.
,Chris takes a deep breath before continuing.
2Finally, I...<pause/> I got caught stealing a car.
Oh my god...
1I can't believe you would do something like that!
Why did you do it?
What were you thinking?
 Believe me, I'm not proud of it.
?I know I have no one to blame but myself, but I was vulnerable.
CI was out of control, and trying to prove myself to my new friends.
7I mean... that just doesn't seem like the Chris I know.
?I was out of control, trying to prove myself to my new friends.
I just wanted to fit in.
What happened then?
AIt was bad. I was facing expulsion and a lengthy juvenile record.
#But then... I got very, very lucky.
How so?
1My school's football coach came and talked to me.
gHe'd reviewed my file and said he could tell that I wasn't a bad kid, just that I was a little... lost.
He took you under his wing?
VHe pleaded my case to the school. I got my grades back up, joined the football team...
B...And after a provisionary period, he even got my records sealed.
bHe was the one who encouraged me to apply to Hartfeld, and helped me get their sports scholarship.
_My mom helped too. After everything I put her through, I'm grateful that she was so supportive.
QIf it hadn't been for their support, I don't know what would have happened to me.
tI'm ashamed of who I was back then. College was supposed to be my fresh start... But now, Sebastian could ruin that!
Chris...
We all make mistakes.
-I can see why you're worried about Sebastian.
aYou were going through a rough patch. What matters is that you were able to turn yourself around.
$I'm really glad you think so, {You}.
JI'm just worried that other people won't see it that way if this gets out.
!I could even lose my scholarship!
BIf this gets out, it could ruin your chance at becoming president!
3Forget the presidency, I could lose my scholarship!
&Well, hopefully it won't come to that.
WI've thought Vasquez was going to cut my scholarship lots of times, but I'm still here!
#Yeah... I guess you've got a point.
_Thanks for listening, {You}. I was afraid to tell you all this, but I'm glad it's off my chest.
(Chris, you know I'm always here for you.
PYou rest your hand on Chris's knee, and Chris gently places his hand over yours.
$I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
AI don't know what I'd do without all the support you've given me.
The feeling is mutual.
;Maybe later I can help take your mind off all this drama...
Now we're talking...
QBut hey, when we get back home, you should really tell the others about all this.
.I guess it'd be best if they heard it from me.
DChris, they're your friends. They'll have your back, no matter what.

I hope so.

Abbie
There you are! Where were you?
Tyler
%You two disappeared after the debate!
Zack
SI'm sure they were just <i>celebrating</i> Chris' success at the debate together...
Actually...
-I need to talk to you guys about something...
;Chris tells everyone about his past and Sebastian's threat.
Wow...
This is a lot to take in...
]I'm really sorry I didn't tell you all sooner. I just wanted to leave those days behind me...
>I thought you'd reject me if you knew all the things I'd done.
Kaitlyn
(What?! Never! Chris, you belong with us!
BYeah, we've been friends long enough to know you're not a bad guy.
You really think so?
TOf course! If we were all judged by the stupid things we did when we were younger...
;Well, we've all had moments we wish we could erase forever.
-Ugh... You just reminded me of my goth phase.
UI say the real villain here is Sebastian. I mean, <i>blackmail?</i> That's just cold.
[We can't just let him mess with Chris like this! We've gotta find a way to get back at him.
Yeah!
.Guys, wait! I don't want you getting involved!
Why not? We want to help you!
CYeah, a guy like that has got to have some dark secrets of his own.
XSeriously, it's not up for discussion. This is between me and Sebastian. Stay out of it.
Please.

But he's not playing fair!
1I know... But I don't want to stoop to his level.
)There must be <i>something</i> we can do.
Your support is enough, really.
KI've made enough trouble in my life before... Let me do this the right way.
Chris...
,You're right, we have to take the high road.
!This isn't the time to act noble!
QTrying to get back at Sebastian will only distract you from your actual campaign.
3Exactly. I want to focus on the <i>real</i> issues.
*And if I win, I want it to be on my terms.
JYou can't beat a rigged game. Besides, your college career is on the line!
WIf I get caught up in personal vendettas, I'll lose sight of what's actually important.
&If I win, I want it to be on my terms.
BSo I need you all to promise me that you won't go after Sebastian.
If you say so.
LAww... I would have <i>loved</i> to wipe the smirk off of that creep's face.
If you ever change your mind...
JI've made my decision. But I'm really happy to know you guys have my back.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_COMEDY_MISCHIEF
\Hey, speaking of the election... I almost forgot about the 'Get Out The Vote' party tonight!
/What? What about the game night we had planned?
1Sorry Tyler... We'll have to do it another night.
3Zack's right. We need to be there to support Chris.
HAnd <i>as if</i> I'd miss a chance to get dressed up for a themed event!
Wait, what's the theme?
_The Swingin' 60s! Oh my god... Can you picture all the slim cut suits and fabulous mod dresses?
RWe're probably going to see a lot more last-minute tie-dye and Birkenstock combos.
A boy can dream.
3I think I'll just wear my dress from winter formal.
8And I have some old clothes that look kind of hippy-ish.
ZYou guys are breaking my heart. {You}, tell me you're planning to go all out for this one.
?I guess I could dress up like a 60s icon, but I'm not sure who.
WHow about Jackie O? I can't think of anyone more classy than her. First lady and all...
JWhich is totally fitting since your boyfriend could be our next president.
&Plus she was a big patron of the arts!
(Guys? Aren't we forgetting someone here?
Uhh...
+What about <jiggle>MARILYN MONROE?</jiggle>
*Oh snap, you're right! I forgot about her!
!How do you forget <i>Marilyn?</i>
?{You}, if you want classy <i>and</i> sexy, Marilyn's your girl.
He's right.

Daaaaayum!
{You}... You look incredible!
That outfit is seriously sexy!
WIf I win this election, you have to promise to sing me 'Happy Birthday, Mr. President!'
.I'll be sure to hang on to this costume, then.
1Mmm... You're so hot, you could win the Cold War.
Hey... <i>Some Like It Hot.</i>
OOkay, we need to get out of here before these two pun each other's clothes off.
Wow, you look...
...Yes?
...Fine. You look fine.
Thanks, Kaitlyn.
)Just watch out for air vents, Ms. Monroe.
Mrs. Kennedy
&You gave Jackie O a run for her money!
AWoah! Did I just step into a time machine and get out in the 60s?
0Because you are a <i>first class</i> first lady!
Seriously... You look amazing!
.I feel like I'm back in American Politics 103!
Aww... You guys!
GIf I win this election, you're gonna make a <i>gorgeous</i> first lady!
-Well, the Kennedys were a pretty sexy couple.
eYeah, maybe I should look into starting another Space Race. Because you are <i>out of this world!</i>
MUgh... Chris, stick with politics and leave the pickup lines to someone else.
Sorry, couldn't resist.
Oh wow, you look...
...Yes?
...Very authentic.
Thanks, Kaitlyn.

tYou and your friends arrive at the party. 60s music blasts from the speakers and tables are set with fancy flatware.
Wow! This place looks great!
#Totally groovy, you might even say.
?And I'm about to groove my way to the bar. Anyone care to join?
&Maybe later... I'm gonna grab a table.
<Zack heads to the bar and Kaitlyn wanders off into the fray.
I'm worried about her.
DLet her go, {You}. She just needs a little space to think right now.
PI know, but I'm just bummed that I don't even get to dance with my girlfriend...
Or whatever we are right now.
QShe'll come around when she's ready, {You}. Just try to have a good time tonight.
*Well, does anyone else want drinks? Chris?
Maybe in a bit.
You doing okay?
*Just stressed about the election, I guess.
|Hey, it's gonna be fine! Think of everyone cheering for you at the debate! All those people want <i>you</i> to be president.
PYeah, no matter what Sebastian says, everyone knows you're the better candidate.
XGuys, let's not even think about the election. Tonight is about relaxing and having fun!
%And Tyler promised me a dance, right?
I did?
6Abbie's right. I think we all need to unwind a little.
You in, {You}?
Actually...
'I could use a break from all the drama!
I'm still mad at Sebastian!
Carefree
*You didn't let politics ruin a good night!

Let's hit the dance floor!
Uh... I really can't dance.
OCome on Tyler, this isn't <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>. Just go with the flow!
With everyone watching?
 Trust me, no one will even care.
#Maybe you could show me some moves?
I'll do my best.
<I'm gonna find Zack at the bar... I'll join you in a minute!

You were no fun at the party.
EI just can't relax knowing that smug jerk is so pleased with himself.
{You}, just drop it.
GSorry guys, I need a moment to calm down. I'll catch up with you later.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_LOVE
WAs you head across the dance floor, you suddenly find yourself face to face with James.

Oh... Hey!
James! What are you doing here?
2Uh... This party's for the whole school, isn't it?
7Yeah, of course... Sorry, my head's all over the place.
,I figured I'd come tonight to support Chris.
I'm sure he appreciates it.
6Wow... You really went all out for the 60s theme, huh?
I do my best.
Well, you look really great.
Thanks.
/So... Um... Have you heard from Vasquez at all?
[Yeah, he called me earlier. He'll be taking some time off to be with Gabriela and the baby.
YWow, Grandpa Vasquez... Somehow I can't picture him willingly playing peek-a-boo, though.
Yeah, me either.
ZI'm just glad that he and Gabriela were able to put their differences aside and reconnect.
?Definitely. I think he's happier than he's been in a long time.
ZIt's nice to know that even after a lot of pain, trust can be restored between two people.
...
KHey... Do you think it'd be weird for two 'acquaintances' to share a dance?
No, it wouldn't be weird.
HJames gently places his hand on your back and leads you in a slow dance.
YJames... We never really talked about what happened. I want to explain my side of things.
Will you at least hear me out?
I'm listening.
Look...
+I only found out about Vasquez by accident.
6If I'd blabbed, I would have betrayed Vasquez's trust.
XHe wasn't planning to tell me either, but I walked in on him during a treatment session.
iHe ordered me not to tell anyone. Especially not you or Gabriela. I think he didn't want people to worry.
|But imagine how we would have felt if he'd suddenly died with no explanation! How is that better than telling us in advance?
aI know, it was a stupid decision not to tell you. But it was <i>his</i> choice to make, not mine.
QHe really didn't want anyone to know. I couldn't go against his wishes like that.
;I just wish he'd trusted <i>me</i> enough to say something.
{James, you know it's not like that. He cares about you, and as illogical as it seems, he just wanted to spare you the pain.
.I just wish he had a better way of showing it.
wI'm really sorry I couldn't say anything. But it was a tough situation, and I hope you understand why I did what I did.
VI do, {You}. And I'm sorry I blew up at you without hearing your side of things first.
6It's okay... I'm glad we finally got to talk about it.
	Me too...
/It's just that trust is really important to me.
AA few years ago, I dated a girl... I was really in love with her.
BBut it turned out she had been seeing someone else behind my back.
SI only found out because I got back from class early one day and walked in on them.
That's terrible! I'm so sorry.
IIt's water under the bridge now... But it's still painful to be reminded.
@Well, I can understand why lying is a sensitive subject for you.
]I didn't know this would hit home so hard. Honestly, hurting you was the last thing I wanted.
MI know that now... I shouldn't have taken it out on you the way that I did...
GI have to say... Being here with you now brings back a lot of memories.
@Remember the time Vasquez made you take me to the sorority ball?
IWell, he didn't exactly have to twist my arm. I was happy to be with you.
,James's hand travels lightly down your back.
(You know, this might sound weird, but...
You've been on my mind a lot.
 Because you've been angry at me?
Well, maybe a little...
#But mostly because I've missed you.
James...
]James pulls you closer and leans his head towards yours. You feel his breath on your cheek...
IThe song you're slow dancing to ends suddenly, replaced by an upbeat jam.
Oh!
Song's over...
Well... I guess I should...
Yeah, of course.
I'll see you around?
Definitely.
áYou part ways with James and look around for your friends. Not far away, Chris and Sebastian appear to be having a heated conversation.
Uh-oh.
[...And as my grandfather always said: you can polish a Buick, but that won't make it a BMW.
You shut your mouth.
]Or you'll do what? Topple my political career by leaking the secrets of my unscrupulous past?
3<i>Oh wait...</i> That's <i>my</i> move, not yours.
gYou act like you're so above it all, but I'll bet there are some pretty nasty skeletons in your closet.
<Don't try to put us on the same level. I'm nothing like you.
I'll take that as a compliment.
OChris storms off. Before you can follow him, you feel a tap on your shoulder...
Becca
Hey, {You}.
Becca?
NUgh, can you not breathe right into my face? Your breath smells like dog food.
@Gee, you didn't even <i>try</i> to dress for the theme, did you?
Neither did you.

What the hell do you want?
TChris isn't doing too well, is he? It sounds like Sebastian really has him cornered.
-Look, if you came over here just to bug me...
4Don't flatter yourself. You're not worth the effort.
iI just thought you should know: I have some dirt on Sebastian that might put Chris ahead in the election.
What?!
Why would you help me?
I don't believe you!
5This doesn't make sense. Sebastian is your boyfriend!
]As much as it pains me to actually agree with you on something, Sebastian is a complete tool.
QI can't argue with that. But why are you telling me this? I thought you hated me!
)Don't worry, that hasn't changed one bit.
&This has got to be some kind of trick!
GAre you always this paranoid? Politics has really done a number on you.
BSave it, Becca! Whatever this is, I don't want to be a part of it.
èCould you not be an idiot for like five seconds? Everyone knows we hate each other. If Sebastian was trying to trick you, why would he send me?
FBelieve it or not, I think I might like him even less than I like you.
CNow <i>that's</i> saying something! What did he do to piss you off?
OHe treats me like total garbage! He never takes me out, never compliments me...
@He's really only interested in himself and this stupid campaign!
wBut listen, okay? I was at Sebastian's place the other night, and he left his laptop open while he was taking a shower.
HHe'd been managing his bank account online, so I decided to take a look.
Wow, gold digger much?
áHey, let's focus on the <i>real</i> bad guy here! It turns out he's been funneling his campaign funds into his <i>personal account!</i>
Seriously? That's huge!
"I can't believe he'd stoop so low.
7Huh, I never would have guessed that you were so moral.
yMorals, schmorals. I don't understand why he'd steal money if he's already rich! I thought only poor people were thieves!
*Um, okay... Anyway, thanks for helping me.
hUgh, it sounds awful when you put it that way. Can we just ruin Sebastian and never speak of this again?
Fine, it's a deal.
?Zack, Tyler, and Abbie approach you, eyeing Becca suspiciously.
%Uh... Everything alright here, {You}?
(Guys, perfect timing! We need your help.

<i>We?</i>
1You tell your friends what you've just learned...
1...So all we need is proof of his shady finances.
QTyler, do you think you can hack Sebastian's computer to access his bank records?
4The legality is questionable, but my skills are not!
OThat's the spirit! Becca, you take Tyler, Zack, and Abbie to Sebastian's place.
 Zack and I can watch the door...
"While <i>I</i> work my tech magic.
#Wait, why is Becca working with us?
KZack, sometimes unlikely alliances are born in pursuit of the greater good.
;And, obviously, I'm the only one who has a key to his dorm.
6That is also a very good point. What about you, {You}?
=I'll find Sebastian and try to distract him as long as I can!
gAfter going your separate ways, you grab a drink and wander through the party until you find Sebastian.

Sebastian!
3Well, well. If it isn't Chris's little cheerleader.
Listen, I need to talk to you.
WSo Chris can't even face me like a man? He has to send you to pick his battles for him?
!I'm not here to talk about Chris.
COh really? Then what on earth could you possibly have to say to me?
It's just that...
)I think you look really handsome tonight.
+I wanted to know what kind of suit that is.
0I have some follow-up questions from the debate.
àI know we haven't been on the best of terms since this election, but I've admired you from the moment I saw you perform in James's play.
Huh?
You inhabited your character with such elegance and ease. It's clear you know a lot about acting. And I like a man with talent.
(Uh... I really don't know what to say...
+Then don't say anything... Just... hold me.
<Are you out of your mind? I don't fraternize with the enemy.
KAre you worried about Becca finding out? I don't even see her here tonight.
7What's wrong with you? I'm giving you a firm <i>no.</i>
(Mmm... I'll bet you can get pretty firm.
%It looks really classy. Is that wool?
L100 percent cashmere. Not that I'd expect <i>you</i> to know the difference.
The buttons are cool too.
Yes, hand crafted in Italy.
)Let me get a closer look at the detail...
;You lean in and 'accidentally' spill your wine on his suit!
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry!
:You idiot! Do you have any idea how much this outfit cost?
gDon't worry, I can get those stains out! Here, I'll pour some of your drink to counterbalance the wine.
You're just making it worse!
)Let's go to the bathroom and wash it out!
7There were some important issues that you didn't cover.
.I thought I was fairly thorough, but ask away.
2I want to talk to you about campus transportation.
What about it?
{All the snow this winter has made it hard to get around campus. Bikes, scooters, and skateboards can't get enough traction.
AAnd pedestrians run the risk of slipping and injuring themselves.
%Hmm, yes, well that's why I plan to--
`So I'm wondering how much of the school's budget you're going to put aside for campus sled dogs.

Sled dogs?
Yup.
As in... actual canines?
With paws and tails.
Let me get this straight...
>Instead of simply hiring more groundskeepers to shovel snow...
U...you're proposing that we install hordes of dogs to shuttle students around campus?
FAbsolutely! There are more than enough shelter dogs in need of a home.
SAnd I'm sure students would love having fluffy friends to play with. Everyone wins!
{You}, what's going on?
What do you mean?
zYou're clearly trying to mess with me. I just can't figure out if you're simply a sore loser or if you're up to something!
I just wanted to talk, honest!
]I don't believe that for a second! If you're going to pester me all night, I'll just go home.
	No, wait!
(What should I do?)
	Kiss him!
	Trip him!
Dance!
	Pucker Up
,You smooched Sebastian for the greater good.
;You grab Sebastian's face and press your mouth against his.
{You}?!
/Oh god... Were you eating garlic bread earlier?
Clumsy
#You sent Sebastian head over heels.
)Sebastian goes tumbling across the floor.
<jiggle>Ooof!</jiggle>
%Oh, I'm so sorry! Let me help you up!
Work It
+You challenged Sebastian to a dance battle.
0You dance vigorously, blocking Sebastian's path.
What do you think you're doing?
3The only way you're leaving is through a dance-off!
Uh...
Get out of my way!
HSebastian pushes past you and heads towards the exit. You run after him.

MUSIC_COLLEGE_ACTION_CHILL

Get the hell away from me!
bAt that moment, Tyler, Abbie, and Zack burst through the doors. Tyler is holding up a flash drive.
The jig is up, Sebastian!
What's going on?
IYou're not the only one who knows how to dig into other people's secrets.
)What's he holding? Is that a flash drive?
Oh, this? It's evidence.
Evidence? Of what?
EOf one of your favorite hobbies. You know, rhymes with gembezzlement.
I don't believe this.
LYou may not, but the student body sure will if they ever catch wind of this.
You... Can't... How...?
jShh, save your energy for your campaign. You're gonna need it now that the playing field has been leveled.
QI suppose you want me to keep my mouth shut about Chris in exchange for the same?
-Well, look at that! Beauty <i>and</i> brains!
Damn it, a stalemate!
So what's it gonna be?
 I can see that I have no choice.
Then it's a deal.
WYes... But I won't forget this. Someday, you're going to regret ever laying eyes on me.
WIs Chris in the clear, or will Sebastian get his revenge? Find out in the next chapter!"
