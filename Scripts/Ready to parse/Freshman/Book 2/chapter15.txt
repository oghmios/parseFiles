tYou and James arrive at the hospital to find Gabriela out front, pacing nervously as she rocks the baby in her arms.
=Gabriela! What happened? Professor Vasquez is <i>missing?</i>
	SURPRISED
Gabriela
sOh, {You}, James, thank god you're here! Dad collapsed again earlier this evening and was admitted to the hospital.
Is he okay?
\Thankfully he stabilized pretty quickly. He said he was feeling well enough to go outside...
`But I don't know what happened! One minute the nurse was bringing him outside in a wheelchair...
$...and the next minute, he was gone!
SAD

What was he doing outside?
bHe said he wanted some fresh air. He told the doctor he'd sue the hospital if they didn't let him.
bWell, he can't have gotten too far in his wheelchair. If we split up, maybe we can track him down!
NGood plan. How about I swing by campus and you check the park down the street?
?Right. Gabriela, why don't you stay here in case he comes back?
\Alright. I'll take this little guy back inside. <pause/>It's just so cold out... What if...?
.Don't worry, Gabriela. We'll find your father.
Then you'd better hurry.

ÅYou wander around the park for almost half an hour. Just when you're about to give up, you see a seated figure by the fountain...
Professor Vasquez?
Vasquez
\Ah, {You}. I figured someone would come looking for me. I should have known it would be you.

Professor!
What are you doing out here?
'It's cold! You need to get back inside!
RHospitals are depressing. Everyone coming and going, all the sick, dying people...
qI needed to get away for while. To feel the cold night air on my skin, to watch people going about their lives...
@I just wanted to get out into the world one last time, before...
uVasquez begins to cough, and immediately starts hacking into a napkin. When he pulls it away it's stained with blood.

Professor!
He waves you away.
MI'm a dying man, {You}. A little blood is the least of my worries these days.
ANGRY
,If the doctor says you should stay in bed...

The doctor is an imbecile.

Professor!
JWell, it's true. I'm already dying, what more could possibly happen to me?
+Let me just enjoy myself while I still can.
&Okay... but I'm staying here with you.
Stubborn as always.
-Vasquez sighs. You notice how tired he looks.
[If you're going to insist on sticking around, at least take me through the park, would you?
hYou grasp the handles of the wheelchair and travel through the park with Vasquez in comfortable silence.
AYou know, {You}, in some ways I'm grateful for this whole ordeal.
	Grateful?
WYes... I know it seems strange, but it made me realize what misplaced priorities I had.
dI spent <i>years</i> estranged from my only daughter, because of a mistake I was too proud to admit.
SWhen I leave this life, my greatest regret will be not making up with her sooner...
 Stop here, please, and sit down.
]You park his wheelchair next to a bench and sit down next to him. He takes one of your hands.
-I know I've put you through hell this year...
Well...
NEUTRAL
That's all in the past.

You're damn right you did.
Honestly, don't worry about it.
cDon't patronize me just because I'm ill, {You}. I know I've caused you more than a few headaches...
[Headaches, stomachaches... hand aches. I didn't even know that was a thing until I met you.
HAPPY
2Indeed. I get them frequently when the muse calls.
3But even with all that, you've taught me so much...
aFrom the day we met, you've been bullheaded, rude, and have tried to ruin my life numerous times!
...
*But even still, I'm really glad I met you.
@You've taught me more at Hartfeld than any of my other teachers.
-Vasquez smiles and gives your hand a squeeze.
1If I could leave you with just one more lesson...
Professor, don't talk like--
!Shut up and let me finish, {You}.
,You press your lips together. Vasquez sighs.
AYou can't leave your life with loose ends and unfinished stories.
IBe with the people you love while you have the chance, and when you do...
lDon't just be with them. <i>Be</i> with them. Be present, be thoughtful, and <i>always</i> fight for them...
:You think back on your memories of those closest to you...

NAll this time, even with all the Becca stuff, I've only wanted to be with you.
&Chris smiles and kisses your forehead.
[{You}... you can just say the word, and I swear, I'm all yours. I'm ready whenever you are.
BG_EXT_CAMPUS_QUAD_WINTER_NIGHT
%I really am sorry about the snowball.
&Want me to kiss it and make it better?
XKaitlyn leans in and kisses your shoulder. Then, she presses a gentle kiss to your lips.
eJames pulls you into a hug. You nestle into the warmth of his chest, your head tucked under his chin.
âYou know, {You}, I've always believed my writing to be the most important thing in my life. But I'm starting to see things differently...
ÇThere's something special about you. I haven't been able to get you out of my head since the day you walked into Vasquez's office.
dI don't want to be with anyone but you. Just say the word, and I'm all yours, whenever you're ready.
hI... I will, Professor. My life is full of wonderful people, and I'm not going to take them for granted.
lAlright, {You}. I've had my say. If something's amiss in your life, then it's up to you to set things right.
Professor...
I don't know if I can!
*Thank you for the advice. I'll do my best.
jI feel like things have gotten so out of hand... How can I make it right after everything that's happened?
LWhat is this, defeat? Where's the relentless, entitled {You} I know so well?
*I've never known you to give up so easily!
"Hey, I've been doing my best here!
Ah, there she is!
HIt's been a tough quarter, but I'm grateful that I've had your guidance.
WPff, don't get sappy on me now! <i>I'm</i> not the one with whom you need to reconcile.
HI suppose a nice, heartfelt moment with you is just too much to ask for.
EForgive me, {You}. I just want you to focus on sorting out your life.
BIt may seem like you've got an insurmountable task ahead of you...
pBut if you don't at least try, you'll spend the rest of your life wondering what would have happened if you had.
ASo don't waste any more time with me. Go. Get your life together.
kAnd start with James. I'm getting really tired of this uncomfortable atmosphere surrounding the two of you.
$Okay, fair enough. I'll talk to him.
YYou take the handles of Vasquez's wheelchair and begin to wheel him back to the hospital.
{You}?
Yes?
I... I'm very proud of you.

tYou return to the hospital to find James talking to Gabriela out front. Gabriela cradles the baby against her chest.
There they are!
YWhat the hell were you thinking, Dad? I was worried sick! You could have frozen to death!
3I'm sorry, Gabriela. I just wanted to see the snow.
@Oh, and you had to sneak off without a word in order to do that?
ZI went to your favorite park. The one we used to go to all the time when you were a child.
UDo you remember the time I brought you there and you made a snowman? You were... six?
...
.Gabriela nods as tears start to fill her eyes.
rI let you dress the snowman in my scarf, and you put a bunch of leaves in his arms. I asked what you were doing...
SAnd you said that he was writing a book, just like your papa. Do you remember that?
Yes... I remember.
fI often think about that day. <pause/>I wanted to go back there today. To remember exactly how it was.
Dad...
(Let's go inside. The baby will get cold.
mYou and James watch as Vasquez and Gabriela disappear through the hospital doors. James lets out a long sigh.
Hey... You okay?
6I'll be fine. It's just been a crazy week, that's all.
Do you want to talk about it?
_It's been hard to process everything. I have so many emotions bumping up against one another...
XI'm angry at Vasquez for keeping his condition a secret, but sad to see him declining...
PI feel hurt that you knew and didn't tell me, but I know it wasn't your fault...
1And part of me misses the way things were before.
+I wish that none of this had ever happened.
I know, James...
#I wish things had gone differently.
But I can't change the past.
WSometimes I wonder what would have happened if I'd never walked in on Vasquez that day.
SI wouldn't have had to lie to you. Even though finding out later would have hurt...
7At least you and I would have gone through it together.
0That would have made things a lot more bearable.
zI've thought about how things could have been different... if I'd told you the truth, if I'd never walked in on Vasquez...
,But sometimes, there is no 'right' decision.
_If none of this had happened, we would probably still be in the dark about Vasquez's condition.
?It's hard to find a silver lining in a situation like this one.
0But... I suppose some good has come of all this.
How so?
HComing face to face with mortality makes you really examine your life...
MWho knows how long any of us have? It may be kind of a morbid thought, but...
No, I know what you mean.
OLife is too short to hold grudges. I want things to be right between us, {You}.
ZYou may have hurt me... but that doesn't outweigh all the happiness you've brought me too.
James...
James takes your hand in his.
Truce?
Truce.
,He pulls you into a hug and holds you close.
James... Kiss me.
ZYou feel the warmth of his body against yours as your lips meet and snow falls around you.
God... I missed you.
I missed you too.
James extends his hand.
Truce?
Truce.
You shake hands.
Thank god. I really missed you.
I missed you too.
QJust... please promise me that from now on, there are no more secrets between us.
RJames, I <i>promise.</i> I never want to put you through anything like that again.
BGood. Because I never want to go through anything like that again.
,So... I guess we should catch up to Vasquez?
<You go on. I have a few other things I need to take care of.
9I guess you have your own set of issues to work out, huh?
2You got that right. But let's hang out soon, okay?
IActually... I was hoping we could go to the boat dance together tomorrow.
_James cups your face in his hands, running his thumb gently across your cheek. He grins at you.
JI figure we could make up for lost time... End the quarter on a high note.
Well...
Yes, of course!

I'm not so sure, actually.
zack_airport
I'd love to!
MGreat, I can't wait! I'm going to be the luckiest guy there, that's for sure.
2We'll see just how lucky you get. Pick me up at 8?
And not a second later.
HI want us to be on good terms... but after everything that's happened...
%I could use a little time for myself.
aI care about you, James. But I need to get my life in order before I get involved in yours again.
)I understand. Take all the time you need.
]Tomorrow, I just want to forget all the drama and have fun. And I hope we'll get to hang out.
)I hope so too. I'm looking forward to it.
 Like at the boat dance tomorrow?
"Definitely. Looking forward to it!
!BG_INT_DORM_BEDROOM_KAITLYN_NIGHT
IAfter trudging through the snow, you arrive home, exhausted but relieved.
iAs you're heading to your room, you notice that Kaitlyn's door is slightly ajar. You poke your head in...
Hey, Kaitlyn...
Oh! Hey, {You}...
7Kaitlyn is curled up on her bed, writing in a notebook.
'Have you started keeping a diary again?
DYeah... But hopefully it will be less embarrassing this time around.
;It helps, you know. Writing lets me sort out my thoughts...
...
Kaitlyn, I--
I just wanted to say sorry--
Oh!
$Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
CI just wanted to apologize for being so pushy about you coming out.
Thinking about it now...
3You needed space, and I should have respected that.
"I only wanted to be there for you.
CI'm sure coming out to your parents like that was a lot to process.
LI'm glad you understand... It's not that I didn't appreciate your support...
JBut working through all those emotions was something I needed to do alone.
8I get it. And I'm sorry that I didn't realize it sooner.
PI appreciate the apology, but I think <i>I'm</i> the one who needs to say sorry.
>I could see that you were hurting, and I thought I could help.
;I was so focused on trying to be a supportive girlfriend...
7I was so focused on trying to be a supportive friend...
UBut I'm sorry I didn't pay more attention to what you <i>actually</i> needed from me.
HWorking through all those emotions was something I needed to do alone...
ABut I'm really grateful to know that you care about me that much.
SYou've been so good to me... I feel like <i>I'm</i> the one who needs to apologize.
,What? But you have nothing to apologize for!
=Don't I? I shut you out when you were only trying to help me.
`Kaitlyn, I know how hard this has been for you... I understand that you needed time to yourself.
OBut I was way too harsh. I was upset about my parents and I took it out on you.
+<pause/>My parents called me the other day.
Yeah? How did it go?
GBetter than I would have thought! My dad apologized for storming off...
UHe's still adjusting, and I don't think he's entirely comfortable with... who I am...
IBut he said that he'll always love me, no matter what. We'll work it out.
(Oh, Kaitlyn! That must be a huge relief!
?But now that I'm out, I was finally able to tell them about us.
CIt got me thinking... none of this would have happened without you!
What do you mean?
1When I'm with you, everything just feels right...
bFor the first time in my life, I don't have to hide who I am. I don't even have to think about it.
FI just know that I'm happy and there's no one else I'd rather be with.

Kaitlyn...
6You take her hand, lacing your fingers between hers...
>I hope you can forgive me for the way I've been acting lately.
There's nothing to forgive.
ACan I at least make it up to you by taking you to the boat dance?
Oh!
Yes please!
Maybe not this time.
It's a date!
=Kaitlyn tenderly rubs her thumb across the back of your hand.
=I can't wait to catch up. Us not talking has been killing me.
0Me too. Tomorrow's gonna be a night to remember.
5Look... We've both been through so much this quarter.
:Honestly, I could use a little time to process everything.
 Yeah, I guess I can't blame you.
NTomorrow, I just want to have fun with you and the gang. No worries, no drama.
9I couldn't agree more. It's gonna be a night to remember.
GBut it got me thinking... none of this would have happened without you!
What do you mean?
>You've been so kind and understanding since the day I met you.
bFor the first time in my life, I don't have to hide who I am. I don't even have to think about it.
?I just know that I'm happy and that you'll always have my back.
Kaitlyn, I feel the same way.
>I hope you can forgive me for the way I've been acting lately.
<There's nothing to forgive. I just want my best friend back!
=I can't wait to catch up. Us not talking has been killing me.

oAfter staying up late talking to Kaitlyn, you wake up early the next morning and wait in the kitchen for Chris.
kHis eyes widen as he walks in and sees the table fully set, a mountain of pancakes teetering in the center.
 Morning, {You}. What's all this?
'It's an apology breakfast. Take a seat.
]You pile a stack of pancakes on Chris's plate as he sits down. The two of you eat in silence.
BThanks, {You}. You're a lifesaver. I <i>needed</i> these pancakes.
qI thought you might. <pause/>Like I said, I'm so, <i>so</i> sorry for what I did. And I know the others are, too.
gWe couldn't stand the way Sebastian was trying to tear you down, so we took matters into our own hands.
Chris nods.
I'm listening.
We should have...
Had faith in you.
Been honest about it.
gYou've been such a class act. Every time Sebastian tried to sabotage you, you refused to take the bait.
;We should have known that you'd be able to handle this too.
dThe more I think about it, the more idiotic I feel. And I'm sorry. I promise I'll never do it again.
Will you forgive me?
ÖFor some reason, when Becca came to me with a solution to <i>your</i> problems, I decided to get everyone involved <i>except</i> you.
UI went behind your back and tried to shelter you like a child. That was stupid of me.
RIf you'll forgive me, I promise I'll never keep a secret like that from you again.
cChris hesitates for a moment. You bite your lip and look down at your pancakes. Finally, he speaks.
1I do. <pause/>Forgive you, I mean. I forgive you.
Oh thank god.
Chris laughs.
I take it this was bugging you?
You have no idea.
sI mean, it's not like I haven't been forgiven for much, much worse. Like I said, everyone deserves a second chance.
.Well, thank you for the pardon, Mr. President.
Mr. President?
The title still feels weird?
Weird... but good.
/I'm glad. Next quarter is going to be kick-ass!
2It will be. And I can't wait to spend it with you.
lSpeaking of spending time together, I was wondering if you'd like to come with me to the boat dance tonight.
Oh!

Of course!
I don't know...
!I wouldn't have it any other way.
AI'm glad. Well, I guess I should give you some time to get ready.
What time are we leaving?
We set sail at 8:00 PM!
+I don't take <i>that</i> long to get ready!
;I'm just teasing. But I bet you'll look amazing regardless.
]After everything that's been going on... I just want to have a chill, fun night with friends.
"I totally understand. No pressure.
SI <i>do</i> care about you, Chris. I just need a little time to myself, that's all.
<Believe me, there's no rush. I'll be here when you're ready.
bBut hey, I'm still looking forward to hanging out with you and everyone at the boat dance tonight.
$Me too. It's gonna be a great night.
I'll see you tonight, then!
I can't wait.
gIsn't it crazy to think that, after tonight, there will only be one more quarter left of freshman year?
8And just a few months ago we thought it would never end.

WEvening arrives, and you and your friends pile into Chris's car and drive to the shore.
eYou board the boat to find it bustling with people. Music from the loudspeakers washes over the deck.
Now <i>this</i> is a party!
9I'll say! This place is <i>classy</i> with a capital 'C.'
KAnd speaking of classy, can I just say that {You} looks absolutely radiant?
*Seriously! Your dress is <i>beautiful!</i>
<Hey, let's not forget that I've got a smokin' hot squad too!
<i>And</i> she's a sweetheart!
bAnd speaking of classy, can I just say that {You} is totally rocking it in the fashion department?
'That means a lot coming from you, Zack!
 Hey, I know style when I see it!
VWhat a way to end the quarter... and I can't think of a better group to spend it with.
Aww, Chris!
I'll toast to that!
Hear, hear!
HLet's make this a <i>real</i> toast. Someone get me a pina colada, STAT!
I'm On A Boat!
Don't you EVER forget!
kYou join the party. Spirits are high as the ocean sighs peacefully and a warm sea breeze rustles your hair.
;...And that's when I <i>really</i> knew Tyler was a keeper.
YCome on, you'd have to be oblivious <i>not</i> to see that Kenna was walking into a trap!
dI guess the couple that makes <i>The Crown and the Flame</i> predictions together... stays together?
EWe were thinking of doing a cosplay together at PixelCon this summer!
@Really?! Oh my god, that would be so cute! Please take pictures!

K...But it's not like Sebastian was ever interested in what <i>I</i> wanted.
6Well, hopefully he's not taking the break-up too hard.
NSpare me the pity, {You}. I'm sure his overinflated ego will cushion the blow.
9He wasn't angry that you helped us sabotage his campaign?
)He may have been a little upset... but...
"Thankfully, I don't actually care.
VIt's a shame things didn't work out between you two... You're kind of a perfect match.
Equals in narcissism...
*You could have been the Kimye of Hartfeld!
ESorry, but there's only room for <i>one</i> diva in my relationships.
The night wears on...
'So you never went square dancing again?
8Well, after a night like that, who would even invite me?
;I never knew that a couple of cows could do so much damage!
GBelieve me, the cows weren't even the issue... It was the potato salad!
.Wait, so the cows knocked over the food table?
[Uh-huh. And the potato salad flew all over the mayor... who's deathly allergic to potatoes!
Oh my god! Was he okay?
0His face swelled up pretty bad, but he survived.
1My reputation as a party guest, however, did not.
<I guess that'll teach you never to mess with any barn doors.
!Oh, consider that lesson learned!
WAs people continue to mingle, you catch sight of Abbie standing alone by the railing...
Hey... everything okay?
8Yeah, I'm good. Just taking a moment to catch my breath.
$You lean on the railing next to her.
VSo, it sounds like you and Tyler have some fun planned! How are things going with him?
CReally good! I mean, I think we both had a lot of learning to do...
ABut he's sweet and smart and funny, and he cares about me, and...
%Well... I think I... <i>love</i> him.
,Abbie, that's great! Have you told him that?
.Not yet... To be honest, I'm a little nervous.
QI don't think you have anything to be worried about. He's clearly devoted to you.
)But what if he doesn't feel the same way?
Abbie...

I'll bet he loves you too.
!It won't be the end of the world.
3He's probably thinking the exact same thing as you.
=I don't know. Are you sure? With him, it can be hard to tell.
WWhen I see you two together, he always looks like he's about to explode from happiness.
JTrust me, he's probably having this same conversation with Zack right now.
#What's the worst that could happen?
BI don't know. I could freak him out and he could break up with me.
REven if he's not at the love stage yet, it doesn't mean he doesn't care about you.
UPeople feel things differently. If he's not ready now, he'll probably get there soon!
5You know, you're right. I actually feel a lot better.
<I'm going to try to work up the courage to tell him tonight.
That's the spirit!
QOkay, I'm not gonna worry about it for now. What about you? How's your love life?
I talked to Chris earlier...
How did that go?
HHe was right to be upset, but he understands that I just wanted to help.
So he's not mad at you anymore?
&I think things are back to normal now.
HYou two have been through so much, but you always manage to work it out.
?Even with all the rough patches, I don't regret being with him.

RBut that doesn't mean I don't want to be with him. I just need a little more time.
'I guess I'm not really sure how I feel.
Hey, there's no rush.
8I think I just need a little more time to figure it out.
LIt's been a crazy year, but I think I want to take some time for myself now.
QI've got great friends, I love my school, and I have my whole future ahead of me.
OThings are going pretty well for me already. Who needs to be in a relationship?
)Fair. That's a good way of looking at it!
8Besides, you've got plenty of time to meet more hotties!
My thoughts exactly.
FLove is complicated, I guess. I'm glad I have you to talk to about it!
bSame! I've been worrying about what to say to Tyler all day. It feels good to get it off my chest.

It's gonna be fine, Abbie.
FI hope so. Okay, I'll stop moping now. Shall we get back to the party?
.You go on ahead; I'll catch up with you later!
AYou see Chris standing near the bow of the ship and hurry to him.
I was hoping I'd find you here.
3I'm glad you did. I was about to come look for you.
HChris glances down at your dress, and a grin breaks out across his face.
Hey, my eyes are up here!
USorry, it's just... You look stunning. Every time I see you, you take my breath away.
Chris...
I really mean it.
I really appreciate it.
So where'd you wander off to?
3I'm glad you did. I was about to come look for you.
3Chris glances down at your dress, smiling slightly.
Hey, my eyes are up here!
*Sorry, it's just... You look so beautiful.
And you're as handsome as ever.
&Chris winks at you and you both laugh.
So where'd you wander off to?
&Where'd you go? I was looking for you.
I was talking to Abbie.
dShe's been a good friend.<pause/> You know, I'm really happy we all got stuck together in the suite.
jMe too. I was <i>terrified</i> to find out who I would have to live with. But I'm so glad it was you guys.
jWe all got pretty lucky. <pause/>But I'm glad that sometimes, we can hang out. Just the two of us, I mean.
jChris brushes your hair out of your eyes and tucks it behind your ear before drawing you into a soft kiss.
tThe two of you lock eyes for just a second too long as you pull away, and you both break out into a fit of laughter.
,Oh, god, I wish this moment would never end.
It doesn't have to.
ÄChris cups your face in his hands, pressing his mouth against yours so fervently you can feel his stubble rub against your chin.
$Mmm... I want tonight to be special.
Oh yeah?
*Maybe we should go somewhere more private.

boat_chris
Me too.
.You think the captain's quarters are unlocked?
Only one way to find out.
BG_INT_BOAT_CABIN_NIGHT
gThe two of you sneak through the boat's interior until the captain's cabin door stands in front of you.
,You turn the knob, and the door swings open.
Mystery solved.
bWhoa, check out this enormous bed! I feel like I could roll over like 5 times without falling off!
*Yeah? What do you say we test that theory?
Only if you carry me there.
£You shut the door behind you and make sure it's locked. Chris lifts you up by the waist, pins you gently against the wall, and goes in for a deep, passionate kiss.
RThe top of your dress starts to slide down as Chris unzips it in the back before--
,{You}, could you give me a little help here?
Oh, shoot, the zipper's stuck!
Just yank on it.
Let me get it.
DYou hear a snag, then a popping noise. The dress falls to your feet.
&PORTRAIT_CUSTOM_OUTFIT_UNDERWEAR_BLACK
Crap, I think I broke it.
$At the moment, I couldn't care less.
6Chris grins wolfishly as he takes in the sight of you.
Me neither.
4Here, let me. No <i>way</i> am I ripping this dress.
oYou carefully coax the zipper right through the snag. The dress slides down your body and puddles at your feet.
6Chris grins wolfishly as he takes in the sight of you.
Now, where were we?
Here.
àYou grab the front of Chris's shirt and lead him to the bed. He tosses his jacket aside and unbuttons his shirt while you undo his belt.
≤Finally, he wriggles out of his pants and they fall in a heap on the floor. You run your hands down his chest, his body illuminated in the moonlight coming in through the window.
L<i>Damn!</i> And here I thought you'd been too busy campaigning to work out!
ChrisShirtless
;I've had a little extra time. Plus, I never miss an ab day.
Chris
UMaybe you can help me with a workout plan. I need a little more cardio in my regimen.
ÇChris pushes you gently back on the bed and climbs on top of you. He starts kissing your collarbone, working his way up your neck.
Oh, I'll show you cardio...
Chris
1He gently nips at the tender skin of your throat.
)Are you gonna stick to my neck all night?
Only if you want me to.
Chris
I want you to...
	Go lower.
Hold me tight.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Chris
SHis mouth glides down to your chest and he nibbles at skin peeking out of your bra.
How much lower?
Chris
<i>Much</i> lower.
`Chris lifts your legs so your knees are locked over his shoulders. He licks at your inner thigh.

Okay, not <i>that</i> low!
lYour spine tingles as his fingers wander downward over your chest, reaching the waistband of your underwear.
Bullseye. Keep going.
`Chris lowers his face between your legs. You feel his breath on your hips and close your eyes...
Shiver Me Timbers
0You had a hot time with Chris at the boat party!
Your wish is my command.
Chris
]Chris flops down beside you and wraps you in his arms. You can smell the cologne on his neck.
8If this boat floated out to sea, I wouldn't even notice.
Chris
SIf that happens then you'd better help row the lifeboat back to shore, Mr. Muscles.
ZFair enough. I suppose I could tear myself away from you long enough for a rescue mission.
Chris
?He kisses the skin right behind your ear and strokes your hair.
!Mmm... I could do this all night.
Chris
Good. Because we're going to.
$That is exactly what I like to hear.
Chris
`His lips meet yours in a tender kiss and it seems as if you're the only two people in the world.
eLater on, you and Chris lie under the tangled sheets of the bed, your head nuzzled against his chest.
{You}, I...
Chris
What is it?
(I love you. From the bottom of my heart.
Chris
sI've been thinking back on my time at Hartfeld, and I've realized that all the happiest moments have been with you.
Chris
+You mean the moments where we've hooked up?
oOkay, yes, those have been great, but I also mean all of the times you were there for me when I needed it most.
Chris
èWithout your encouragement, I don't know if I would have even run for school president, let alone won. You make me feel like I can do anything.

_Of course. I never want to pressure you, and it doesn't change the way I feel about you at all.

sYou lie in each other's arms for a few more moments, your head rising and falling against his chest as he breathes.
$Do you want to go back to the party?
CNo. <pause/>But we should. Our friends are probably looking for us.
Chris
3Let's go find them... <pause/>After we get dressed.
You pick up your dress and see that the zipper pull has come off on one side. You slide it back on and test it out a few times.
Good as new.
1Thank goodness. You look beautiful in that dress.
[Chris puts his arm around you, and you nuzzle up against him as you watch the churning sea.
ADid you know that I've never been out in a boat like this before?
Really? Aren't you from Maine?
8I've been on little fishing boats, but never a big ship.
FReally? Well, they do say that college is all about trying new things.
CAnd there's no one in the world I would rather be trying them with.

So, do you want to dance?

I thought you'd never ask.

6As you return to the deck, you run right into Kaitlyn.
*Hey, there you are! I was looking for you!

Always the charmer, {You}.
Hey, I try.
HI've been so wound up lately... I almost forgot what relaxing felt like.
<Better enjoy it while you can. Freshman year's not over yet!
!I will... as long as you're here.
7I'm glad we're finally getting a moment alone together.
ëKaitlyn wraps her arms around your waist, brushing her lips against yours. You press closer to her, and she runs her hands up and down your body.
jAs she leans deeper into the kiss, you can taste her strawberry chapstick. Finally she tears herself away.
FMmm... I can't think of anything that would make tonight more perfect.
+Well, I can think of a <i>few</i> things...

CSave the sleeping for later! We've got more important things to do.
HGee, I don't know... What could <i>possibly</i> keep me awake right now?
I have a few ideas...
òKaitlyn presses her body against yours and begins trailing gentle kisses downward from your neck. You shiver as you feel her mouth against your stomach.
Mmm... Don't stop.
ãStraddling your hips, she pulls her hair loose, letting it fall onto her shoulders. She slowly unzips her dress and drags it over her head.

wHmm, my eyelids are still pretty heavy. You're gonna have to work harder than that if you want to get my blood pumping.

?Well, being here with you is the most fun thing I can think of.
JThe <i>most</i> fun thing? Surely there's room for a little more fun here.

?Well, if you wanted to relax, I think we're in the right place.
pJames sits down beside you. You feel his fingers trace the back of your neck, and a shiver runs down your spine.
 Ah! You're giving me goosebumps!

CJames moves his hands to your shoulders and begins to massage them.

Ohh... That feels amazing.

GJames rubs your back, slipping his fingers down the back of your dress.
How's this?
Mmm... Lower.
?He works his hands along your spine, pausing to kiss your neck.
,I hope you're enjoying this as much as I am.
ZHe flips you onto your back and begins to kiss you, his body hovering right above yours...

TEvery inch of me is glad... especially my back. Let me know when you want to switch.

oTrust me, James, I <i>want</i> to be with you. I can perfectly remember every second we've ever spent together.
AAnd who knows? With a little time, I'm sure I'll catch up to you.
$I'll wait as long as you need me to.
James
9I guess we should get dressed and head back to the party.
James
^Yeah... I'm glad we got to spend some time alone together, though. Let's do it again sometime.
2Well, I'm not sure if I can get us another boat...
James
You know what I mean!
$I'm just teasing. Come on, let's go.
James
8And I'm looking forward to picking up where we left off.
<Me too. I've really been hoping for a moment alone with you.
Yeah?
]Yeah. I've been thinking back on this year, and, to be honest, you've really changed my life.
ÇYou gave me the courage to stand up to my parents, you helped me with my play... not to mention all the other fun times we've had.
bEven with all the Vasquez stuff, I wouldn't change a thing. I want to be with you, no matter what.
James...
{You}... I love you.
	Oh wow...
I feel the same way.
I'm flattered.
Relationship Improved
.Your relationship with James will be affected.
I love you too!
&Thank god. I was worried for a second.
;There's nothing to worry about. You've changed my life too.
_James kisses you softly at first, and then more urgently, the kiss deepening with every second.
sFinally, he pulls away, breathless, and rests his head against yours. You feel his eyelashes flutter on your cheek.
FTonight has been perfect. I couldn't even write a more romantic scene.
-Maybe you can work this into your next story.
6Maybe. Or maybe I'll just keep this memory for myself.
AI care about you a lot, but I don't think I'm ready for this yet.
AWell, I can't say I'm not a little crestfallen. But I understand.
^I still want to be with you. Who knows? Give it a little time, and maybe I'll catch up to you.
I'll keep my hopes up.
`Yeah. I've been thinking back on this year, and I've really enjoyed the time we've had together.
ÇYou gave me the courage to stand up to my parents, you helped me with my play... not to mention all the other fun times we've had.
2I'm so happy everything has worked out between us.

LShe grabs Tripp from behind and starts pumping her fists into his diaphragm.
EWait... <pause/>what... <pause/>are... <pause/>you... <pause/>doing!?
5The Heimlich Maneuver! I don't want you to suffocate!
/Huh? But... Uh, I'm fine, don't worry about it.

XWell I hate to be the one to break it to you, but you're barking up the wrong tree, pal.
<You guys, stop fighting! There aren't even any trees around!
XOkay Tripp, if you're so confident, why don't you let <i>Madison</i> decide for herself?
Wait, what am I deciding?
"Who do you like better, me or him?
But you're both my friends!
6Madison, we're not talking about being <i>friends</i>.
...Best friends?
)We both want to be your <i>boyfriend!</i>
=Madison notices you approaching and quickly runs over to you.
+{You}! Oh thank goodness! I need your help!
What's going on?
\It turns out that Logan and Tripp both have a crush on me, but I don't know who I like more!
Okay, how can I help?
VI mean, you know what it's like to have a bunch of people who are all into you, right?
Yeah... All too well.
So how did you choose?
=At first I thought that I had to decide who I liked the most.
ZBut in the end, I chose myself. I want to focus on who <i>I</i> am and what <i>I</i> want.
1But what if I <i>do</i> want to pick one of them?
)I liked them all for different reasons...
FBut Chris always made me feel like the most special girl in the world.
bBut Kaitlyn was already such a close friend, I was happy when our relationship started to develop.
YBut James was always so encouraging and supportive, and I couldn't help but fall for him.
KTripp and Logan have both been good to me... I just don't know who to pick!
Well...
Logan is a really funny guy.
Tripp is definitely unique.
AIf you don't know who you like more, then maybe you're not ready.
@I think a sense of humor can really make a guy sexier, you know?
<Yeah, you're right! Logan always knows how to make me laugh.
Madison turns back to the boys.
@Okay... You're both awesome, but...<pause/> I really like Logan.
9Oh yeah! Who's barking up the wrong tree <i>now,</i> huh?
Logan, don't be a jerk!
+Sorry, I'm just really happy you picked me.
,I'm gonna go find Edgar. See you guys later.
+Tripp walks off with his shoulders slumped.
Wait! Tripp!
Let him go, Madison.
"I just don't want him to be upset.
NLook, let's just focus on <i>us</i> right now. I want you to be happy tonight.
Oh Logan, I already am.

Madison turns back to you.
AThanks so much for helping me out, {You}. I really appreciate it.
Hey, any time.
FBy the way, I think your friends are looking for you on the main deck.
+Thanks! I'll give you lovebirds some space.
XHe may seem a little weird sometimes, but a relationship with him would never be boring.
?Yeah, you're right! He always says the most interesting things!
Madison turns back to the boys.
@Okay... You're both awesome, but...<pause/> I really like Tripp.
Wait... Really?
(This dweeb? You've got to be kidding me!
%Logan pushes past you and storms off.
Wait! Logan!
!Let him go, Madison. He's a jerk.
&Don't say that! He's my <i>friend!</i>
=What kind of friend is he if he doesn't support your choices?
WLook, let's not worry about it right now. I want to enjoy some time with my girlfriend.
F'Girlfriend...' It sounds so weird to hear you say it. But good weird.

Madison turns back to you.
AThanks so much for helping me out, {You}. I really appreciate it.
Hey, any time.
FBy the way, I think your friends are looking for you on the main deck.
+Thanks! I'll give you lovebirds some space.
CYou don't <i>have</i> to be in a relationship if you don't want to.
RYeah, you're right! I like them both as friends, and I don't want to mess that up!
Madison turns back to the boys.
JListen... You're both awesome, but I'm not interested in dating right now.
But... Seriously?
After everything?
?I just want to be friends right now. Take it or leave it, boys!
#Well... It's your choice after all.
FI mean, I think it'd be a <i>better</i> choice if you chose me, but...
6Great! Then we're all friends and nothing will change.
...
...

Madison turns back to you.
AThanks so much for helping me out, {You}. I really appreciate it.
Hey, any time.
FBy the way, I think your friends are looking for you on the main deck.

Thanks, I'll go find them!
See you later!
ABack on the main deck you find your friends gathered in a circle.
:There you are! Grab a drink--we're getting ready to toast!
Great! What are we toasting to?
CTo the great times we've had so far, and to even more next quarter!
Oh... yeah. Next quarter.

{You}, is something wrong?
TYou all know that Vasquez doesn't have much time left. And it just occurred to me...
%When he's gone, so is my scholarship!
2But there's got to be <i>something</i> you can do!
gLook, whatever happens, I want you guys to know that you've made this one of the best years of my life.
fEven if it has to come to an end, I'm thankful for all the time I've had at Hartfeld... however short.
-Zack clears his throat and taps on his glass.
"If I could just say a few words...
HI think we can all agree that this has been a pretty eventful quarter...
LWe've each had our ups and downs, but one thing remains the same throughout.
+We take care of each other, no matter what.
)Whether we're studying for tough exams...
...
Confronting our problems...
...
Facing loss...
...
Or figuring out who we are...
...
W...We can all be grateful knowing that our friends will be there to help us through it.
I'll drink to that!
Hear, hear!
2Everyone cheers and clinks their glasses together.
FGuys... You're the best people in the world. Thank you for everything.
;I just can't believe it might be our last quarter together.
-Why the long faces? The night's not over yet.
!Zack begins loosening his bowtie.
Uh, Zack? What are you doing?
6If it's our last night, then it's got to be memorable!
<jiggle>COWABUNGA!!!</jiggle>
CZack rushes to the edge of the boat, then jumps off into the water!

Oh my god!
Zack, are you okay?
Zack calls out from the water.
.Come on down, you guys! The water feels great!
Well, you heard the man.
'Everyone laughs and jumps in after him!
Bombs away!
Woo hoo!
Check this out!
Cannonball!

Swan dive!

Bellyflop!
.You plunge into the water, splashing everyone!
Hey, watch it!
SYou gracefully dive headfirst into the water before gliding back up to the surface.
	Show off!
JYou hit the water with a splat and feel the air knocked out of your lungs.
{You}, are you okay?
)Ugh... Okay, that was not my finest idea.
9Hey, this is <i>way</i> colder than I was led to believe!
#Just keep swimming, you'll warm up!
,Abbie swims to Tyler and starts kissing him.
<i>I</i> can warm you up.
4Whoa, I can't swim <i>and</i> kiss at the same time!
As much as I'd like to.
/Listen, Tyler... There's something I want to...
tyler_abbie
<jiggle>I LOVE YOU!!!</jiggle>
Oh! I...
.Oh my god. Sorry, I didn't mean to... I just--
)Tyler! I was about to say the same thing!
I love you too!
Really? Wow, I...
I'm so happy.
_Okay, is there a buoy we can grab onto? Because swimming or not, I need to kiss you <i>NOW.</i>
Let's give them some space.
What is it?
Ummm...
It's just...
"Do you think there are any sharks?
Sharks?
...Yeah.
FProbably not this close to shore. They tend to stick to deeper waters.
	Oh. Okay.
&Relax, we have nothing to worry about.
=You guys... I can't think of a better way to end the quarter.
;Me either. This has been one of the best nights of my life!
,Promise me we're always going to be friends?
BCross my heart and hope to drown a watery death at the hands of...
<shake_portrait/>Ahhh!
Zack! What is it?
\Sorry, some seaweed just brushed my leg. Okay, I'm regretting my decision to jump overboard.
No! No regrets!
5Come on, I'll race you all to those rocks over there!
Winner buys everyone ice cream!

[Thanks for meeting with us, {You}. I know you weren't planning to come back this quarter...
oIt's no trouble, really. I needed to come pick up the last of my things anyway. How's the baby doing, Gabriela?
Getting bigger every day.
Have you decided on a name?
Enrique. After his grandfather.
UThat's beautiful, Gabriela. I'm sure if Professor Vasquez were here he'd be so proud.
lIt's a shame little Rico won't get to meet his namesake. But I want him to remember who his grandfather was.
I'm sure he will.
PI know you were close. What do you think I should tell little Enrique about him?
!Tell him Professor Vasquez was...
Hard working.
Driven.
	Stubborn.
bEven after his diagnosis, he didn't slow down on his book. In fact, I think he worked even harder.
VMy dad's work ethic was one of his best qualities. I hope Enrique inherits some of it.
OWhen he had a goal, nothing stood in his way. He always had a sense of purpose.
1I hope little Enrique will be just as determined.
`He could be difficult sometimes, but he knew what he wanted, and he stood firmly on his beliefs.
MIf little Enrique inherits anything from him, I hope it will be his tenacity.
YHe wasn't perfect, but he was a good person. He gave me a chance when I really needed it.
I'll miss him.
I will too.
ABut I'm glad to hear he made such a positive impact on your life.
.I'm just sad that it wasn't enough in the end.
What do you mean?
BNow that Vasquez is gone, so is my scholarship. I can't stay here.
&Gabriela and Yasmin exchange a glance.
About that...
={You}...<pause/> My father made a note in his will about you.
What? Really?
SHe will continue to fund your scholarship with his inheritance... on one condition.
#<i>You</i> have to finish his book.
