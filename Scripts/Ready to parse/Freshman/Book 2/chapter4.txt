Chapter Four: Playing the Part
The Freshman
You
BG_INT_THEATER_NIGHT
You push through the crowd to see the cast list, finally coming face-to-face with the lined paper stapled to the theater bulletin board.
!Playing the role of William is...
	SURPRISED
	Kaitlyn?!
HAPPY
Kaitlyn
,Whoa, really? But I read for Duke Eccleston!
Chris
So if you're William, who am I?
)Looks like <i>you</i> got Duke Eccleston!
Guess we switched parts!
NWell, if I can't be a hot stableboy, I guess a hot duke's the next best thing!
Tyler
>I don't remember seeing 'hot' anywhere in his character bio...
(C'mon, Tyler. Just let me have this one.
FYou and Kaitlyn step aside so everyone else can look at the cast list.
1So... looks like we're co-stars now. You excited?
Definitely! I can't wait to...
NEUTRAL
 Spend time with all our friends!
Spend time with you!
$Kiss you in front of tons of people!
You're adorable.
I know.
>Are you at all, you know, <i>nervous</i> about our stage kiss?
&Huh? What's there to be nervous about?
Oh, nothing, I just...

kaitlyn
USame. We're gonna be together pretty much 24/7... hopefully you don't get sick of me.
aThat's impossible. I'm just glad we'll have plenty of time to rehearse our stage kiss together...
4Are you at all, you know, <i>nervous</i> about that?
&Huh? What's there to be nervous about?
Oh, nothing, I just...

'Oh, right... forgot that was happening.
.What's wrong? We've kissed in public before...
I know, I just...
'Oh, right... forgot that was happening.
Are you nervous?
No, I just...
,Never mind, I'm being silly. This'll be fun.
AJust then, James arrives, carrying a dozen scripts under his arm.
James
*Ah, I see you've all found the cast list--
Becca
*Yeah, and I'd like to have a <i>word</i>--
ANGRY
”Let's just get this out of the way now... All casting decisions are final. So long as you're performing on <i>my</i> stage, <i>I</i> make the rules.
+But you obviously just cast {You} because--
I'm done talking about this.
AIf we're going to have a problem, you can just leave now. Got it?
XBecca glares at James but doesn't say anything more. He shifts his attention to Kaitlyn.
]Kaitlyn, can I have a word with you in private? I want to give you some backstory on William.
Okay!
_As Kaitlyn follows James to the theater's attached office, Chris ambles over, looking sheepish.
KGuess I got a little ahead of myself, thinking <i>I'd</i> be the lead, huh?
SAD
Oh...
Not at all! You did your best.
!Honestly, I wish it had been you.
.Yeahhh, not sure what you were thinking there.
;Yeah... I guess I'm just used to my best being good enough.
4Well, you can't be good at <i>everything</i>, right?
[Guess not. But I'd settle for being at good at just <i>one</i> thing other than football...
`I mean, it's not like you're <i>bad</i> at this. Duke Eccleston's still a pretty sizable role...
Relationship Improved
.Your relationship with Chris will be affected.
chris
/After all... we already know we have chemistry.
AThanks, {You}. But... Kaitlyn <i>was</i> pretty amazing up there.
,Whereas I... wasn't good enough, apparently.
dThat's not true. You <i>were</i> good... James just had a different vision for the role, that's all.
I guess.
oAnything I can do to cheer you up? Since we won't be getting that stage kiss, how does a <i>real</i> one sound?
dChris grins as you pull him close, cupping his cheek with your hand and standing up on your tiptoes.
%I'd say that sounds pretty damn good.
Thought you might say that...
[You press your lips against Chris's, feeling his arms wrap around you and hold you tight...
…I know you were hoping this'd be a fresh start for you, Chris... and it still can be. Duke Eccleston's still a pretty sizable role...
Ouch!
Sorry... just being honest.
MI know. It just... somehow it's worse to hear say someone <i>else</i> say it.
cI was hoping this could be a fresh start for me, something to hang my hat on other than football...
/But it looks like that's not gonna be the case.
8Why not? Duke Eccleston's still a pretty sizable role...
I know you're right, but...
ZSomehow I still feel like I'm right back on the bench like I was at the start of the year.
hJust then, Kaitlyn comes out of the office with a sly smile on her lips and walks over to you and Chris.
)What were you two talking about in there?
KJames told me a 'secret' about my character to help me with my performance.
Really? What is it?
4I can't tell you, duh! Then it wouldn't be a secret.
MJames leans around the corner of the director's office door and calls you in.
,Your turn, {You}. Could you join me in here?
Sure thing!
=Looks like <i>I'll</i> have a secret of my own soon enough...
Bet mine's better.
<i>Riiiight...</i>

MUSIC_COLLEGE_ACTION_CHILL
BG_INT_OFFICE_GENERIC
^You find James sorting through stacks of character bios and scene outlines, his brow furrowed.
	Busy day?
>You have no idea. I'm starting to think I need an assistant...
_I'd offer my services, but I suspect I'm about to be <i>very</i> preoccupied with rehearsals...
EYou are indeed. Which brings me to the reason I called you in here...
4You're going to tell me a secret about my character?
How did you...
%Ah, Kaitlyn blabbed. Should've known.
cIf it's any consolation, she absolutely refused to tell me what her character's secret actually is.
Good on her.
“Essentially, the secret is just an actor's tool to help you find the character, so to speak. The audience won't know about it, but <i>you</i> will.
0I've decided that Elizabeth's secret should be--
oHold up. If the audience won't even know about it, I feel like <i>I</i> should come up with Elizabeth's secret.
&Uh, okay... what did you have in mind?
Let me think...
1She wants to leave home and become an adventurer!
She has only months to live!
She's a time traveler!
iI like it... Stories of exotic adventures were wildly popular with the English gentry back in those days.
qIt'd make sense for Elizabeth to grow up reading those stories and dreaming of a life beyond her family's estate.
xAnd her attraction to William makes even more sense now, since he actually <i>saw</i> some of that world during the war.
Scarlet fever?
*Tuberculosis. Even her parents don't know.
†Heavy. I <i>guess</i> that works... it explains why she'd care less about doing what's expected of her, since she doesn't have long...
4Just don't go into a coughing fit on my stage, okay?
No promises.
I'm... not sure I follow?
[Basically, she's come from a distant future to study Victorian-era British society. Simple.
VOkay, but... did she show up as an infant? Why are her parents, you know, her parents?
FBrainwashing, duh. How much more of this do you need explained to you?
JUh, I guess I'm good... just try not to mention any of that onstage, okay?
No promises.
KJames shuffles some papers on his desk and stands up, heading for the door.
OWell, I guess we've got that sorted. I look forward to working with you, {You}.
Same...
$I can hardly wait for opening night!
This should be... interesting.
0Feel free to call me into your office anytime...
JLet's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still <i>tons</i> of work to do.
#You're a lot of fun, you know that?
I try.
OI'd settle for productive, but, sure... interesting feels pretty accurate, too.
Relationship Improved
.Your relationship with James will be affected.
james
,James turns around and gives you a sly look.
FYeah, I imagine we're going to need to meet one-on-one pretty often...
pYou sit up on the desk and beckon him closer until he's bending over you, his lips just barely touching yours...
Sounds about right...
kYou tilt your head and up and kiss James, softly at first. He leans into the kiss, his arms encircling you.
3People are going to wonder what's taking so long...
1I'm sure they can make a pretty accurate guess...
SBut I'm not sure they'll appreciate being kept waiting. We'd better cut this short.
If you insist...
?James gives you one last kiss, then you hop down from the desk.
Want me to send anyone else in?
…Not right now. We should get the whole cast working together as soon as possible... I'm thinking we'll do our first line reading now.
!Sounds like a plan, Mr. Director.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_ACTION_FUN
You follow James out into the theater, where the rest of the cast sits scattered through the seats, talking and laughing with their friends.
All right, everyone, listen up. I'd like us to do our first line read, just to go through the script and get a sense of the play as a whole.
/Everyone ready? I'll read the stage directions.
t<i>The year is 1897. The light of dawn slants through the curtains of Elizabeth Darling's bedroom, waking her...</i>
$Today's the day! Will's coming home!
BG_INT_THEATER_CURTAINS_NIGHT
BWithin a few days, you're rehearsing onstage with full blocking...
Zack
aThis is preposterous! Lord Rathbone is an excellent match, an <i>excellent</i> match, I tell you!
SYour father's right, Elizabeth. He's one of the wealthiest bachelors in the county.
6What reason could you possibly have to not desire him?
3You don't understand, Father... and you never will!
_You turn and flee offstage, slamming the door of Abbie's set so it nearly falls off its hinges!
Abbie
6Oops, sorry, {You}! I'll get to work on fixing that...
YYou and Kaitlyn stand in a rosy spotlight rigged up by Tyler and hold each other close...
,I-I thought I'd never see you again, Will...
1Oh, Lizzie... don't you know I'd never leave you?
KBut, the war... I was so afraid! I hardly dared dream you'd return to me...
I'm here now, aren't I?
JKaitlyn tucks a stray strand of hair behind your ear and leans in close...
&So, this is when we would kiss, right?

Um... yes?
$Please just continue with the scene.

Kaitlyn...
You totally killed the mood!
Are you nervous about this?
.Sorry! I just... agh, never mind. It's stupid.
What?
CI just feel weird about this, okay? Sorry for 'killing the mood'...
UI'm sorry, I was just teasing! I didn't know you were actually upset... What's wrong?
No, of course not!
Are you sure?
I...
Yes. I'm... nervous.
Why?
MUSIC_COLLEGE_LOVE_SAD
qWith everyone turned to look at the two of you, Kaitlyn hurriedly walks offstage and heads for the theater doors.
$Sorry... I just need a second, okay?
Of course...
LJames gestures for you to follow Kaitlyn with a meaningful tilt of his head.
(Probably best to make sure she's okay...
Of course. I'll be right back.
BG_EXT_CAMPUS_QUAD_WINTER_DAY
gYou follow Kaitlyn out into the snow and find her sitting by herself on a bench, her face in her hands.
Kaitlyn...?
bHey, {You}... I'm fine now, I just needed some air. I'll be right back inside to finish the scene.
%You sit down on the bench beside her.
0You're clearly <i>not</i> fine. What's going on?
It's so dumb, honestly.
I don't mind.
3Kaitlyn lets her hands fall into her lap and sighs.
VIt's just... I don't know if I told you this, but I'm not, like, <i>out</i> back home.
bI told one of my closest friends back in high school, but nobody else knows. Including my parents.
Oh, Kaitlyn...
~I guess... seeing them again over break, and then coming back here and kissing a girl in front of all our friends and stuff...
‰I just suddenly imagined how they would react if they saw that. I love them, but... they're not the most open-minded people in the world.
I'm sorry, Kaitlyn...
 I'm glad you told me about this.
(But you shouldn't worry what they think.
]Thanks, {You}. I know it's a little awkward for you to hear, cause of, you know, <i>us</i>...
BDon't worry about me. I just want to make sure <i>you're</i> okay.
iYou pull Kaitlyn close and hold her as the snow falls gently around you. She sniffles into your shoulder.
WYou're the best. Seriously, I don't know <i>what</i> I did to deserve someone like you.
4You lean down to kiss the top of Kaitlyn's forehead.
XYou didn't have to do anything. Just you being you is enough to make me crazy about you.
You're such a flirt.
And you love it.
`Kaitlyn tilts her chin up and closes her eyes, and you lean down to kiss her gently on the lips.
Ready to go back inside?
Kaitlyn nods slowly.
Yeah... I think I am.
>Thanks, {You}. I know it's a little awkward for you to hear...
BDon't worry about me. I just want to make sure <i>you're</i> okay.
aYou pull Kaitlyn into a hug as the snow falls gently around you. She sniffles into your shoulder.
XYou're the best. Seriously, I don't know <i>what</i> I did to deserve a friend like you.
mI think you kinda sealed the deal when you didn't tease me for showing up with coffee stains on my clothes...
That's all it took, huh?

Hey, I'm easily impressed.
&Kaitlyn giggles and wipes at her eyes.
Ready to go back inside?
Kaitlyn nods slowly.
Yeah... I think I am.
It's not that simple, {You}...
I know... it's just...
FI'm nervous about... us. And I know that's kinda selfish, but... I am.
'I don't want you to be ashamed of me...
DI'm not! It's... it's complicated, {You}. <i>Really</i> complicated.
eWhen I'm at school, it's really easy to forget about my parents, and home, and all of that, you know?
But then it'll sneak up on me out of the blue, and I'll feel like I'm lying to them. Even if it's just by omission or whatever.
<I... I get it. I'm sorry for making things more difficult...
9Don't be sorry. The whole thing just <i>is</i> difficult.
,But... at least I've gotten it off my chest.
6I think... I think I might be ready to go back inside.
<I just wish you didn't have to put up with that, that's all.
CWell, it's mostly not an issue cause I don't bring it up... at all.
That's not fair to you...
GSo? At least it keeps things from getting even <i>more</i> complicated.

I guess...
^Look, it's a pretty difficult situation already. And... I know you're just looking out for me.
5It was good to get this stuff off my chest, at least.
6I think... I think I might be ready to go back inside.
jYou and Kaitlyn go back inside the theater. James looks up, relieved to see Kaitlyn looking more cheerful.
9Everything okay? We can break for the day, if you want...
:That won't be necessary. Tyler, cue the romantic lighting!
On it!
EYou and Kaitlyn take your marks onstage, and you resume your scene...
1Oh, Lizzie... don't you know I'd never leave you?
KBut, the war... I was so afraid! I hardly dared dream you'd return to me...
I'm here now, aren't I?
”Kaitlyn puts a hand on your waist and pulls you close, then leans in to kiss you, her mouth finding yours as the rest of the cast starts cheering...
Madison
Ow ow ow! Take notes, boys!
Logan
$I don't have anything to write with!
Tripp
?Good thing I never leave home without my sonic screwdriver pen!
Ugh, <i>nerd</i>!
DYou and Kaitlyn break apart, and James flashes you both a thumbs-up.
cExcellent work, both of you. This play lives or dies by the romantic chemistry between its leads...
(And so far, I'd say we're in safe hands.
bA short while later, you and your friends are helping James tidy up the theater after rehearsal...
iHey, {You}? Thanks again for talking me through that... I know I kinda made a scene in front of everyone.
GDon't be embarrassed. And... if you ever want to talk, I'm always here.
=Actually, I was kinda thinking we could go <i>shopping...</i>
Huh?
Well, I know James doesn't expect us to get costumes in time for opening night since it's less than a week away, but I thought... why not try, you know?
There's this costume store downtown that might be worth a visit. And since we're the leads, I figure <i>we</i> should be in costume, at least. Right, James?
9James looks up from helping Abbie with the set and grins.
cI mean, I always envisioned this as a costume drama... It just wasn't feasible given our timeframe.
But it gives the play an extra layer of meaning if you two are the only ones in costume... simultaneously outside of the era's constraints and bound by them.
Uh, sure, totally.
PMainly I just want to dress up as a hot British soldier. What do you say, {You}?
play_costumes
"Dressing up in Victorian costumes?

How can I possibly say no?
kaitlyn_costumes
I must unfortunately decline...
%Yay! This is going to be so much fun!
SJust make sure you're back in time for our meeting with Vasquez later, okay, {You}?
HDon't worry, <i>mom</i>, I'll make sure she's back at a reasonable hour.
Bye!
	Aw, what?
xI'm sorry... I'm kind of behind on homework. Not all of us can star in a play <i>and</i> stay on top of everything else.
HIf you think flattery will make me forgive you, you're absolutely right.
I had a feeling.
pNot to pile on more stuff, {You}, but just so you don't forget we <i>do</i> have a meeting with Vasquez later...
Urgh. Right. That.
RYou head back to the suite and spend the next few hours catching up on homework...

MUSIC_COLLEGE_COMEDY_MISCHIEF
Later that evening, you and James step into Professor Vasquez's office to find Yasmin Udoka sitting in the chair across from his desk. She turns as you enter.
Yasmin
mAh, James, {You}, I'm glad you're both here. Perhaps <i>you</i> can talk some sense into this old curmudgeon.
Vasquez
,Unlikely. I prefer to make my own decisions.
:Is this about the digital rights to <i>Winter in July</i>?
UWhat else? I'm not ready to commit to renewing its publication, digital or otherwise.
oIf you would at least give me a <i>reason</i> for your stubbornness, we could have a conversation about this...
OI don't want to have a conversation. I want to be left alone to think about it.
-Then... why did you call us in here, exactly?
EI'd like to be kept appraised of how the play is coming along. James?
Oh, yeah, it's good!
SEveryone's been doing good work. I'd say we'll be in great shape for opening night.
FReally? No on-set drama? No one's stormed out of the theater in tears?
JPlease tell me that's not the only reason you wanted us to put on my play.
9Well, it's up there, but it's not the <i>only</i> reason.
DWhat about it, {You}? Is everything going as smoothly as James says?
Well...
(Chris was disappointed with the casting.
!Kaitlyn's nervous about the kiss.
%Becca's bitter, but what else is new?
dAh, the star quarterback trying to make a fresh start. I imagine he thought <i>he'd</i> be the lead?
$Yeah, he was kind of counting on it.
How utterly entitled!
LI think you're being a little hard on him... He <i>was</i> my second choice.
8Kaitlyn just turned out to be a better fit for the role.
RA fascinating development. This has certainly been a productive assignment so far!
MAh, interesting... I wouldn't have expected that. She's usually so confident.
#Since when do you even talk to her?
JI don't. But your essays are so insightful, I feel like I know her myself.
oRight... speaking of which, you're going to change the names and character details for the actual novel, right?
zSomehow I don't think Kaitlyn would appreciate learning that our private conversations are going to end up in your book...
nOf course, of course. I don't want to hurt anyone with my work. I simply want to get at something <i>real</i>.
0Sure. Just make sure it's not <i>too</i> real...
aCan you blame her? You've been an absolute blight on her existence since you first enrolled here.
VWhat are you talking about? If anything, <i>she's</i> a blight on <i>my</i> existence.
cOh, {You}. Sometimes I forget how young you really are. So shortsighted. Such a narrow perspective.
5You literally could not be more annoying right now...
EIn any case, it sounds like progress has been good overall. I'm glad.
]Me too. Now I have something to look forward to other than our repetitive arguments, Enrique.
RSpeaking of your play, James, I read the script, and it's good. Excellent, even...
 Thanks! That means a lot, Miss--
7There's just one problem. The ending. It'll never sell.
"Huh? What's wrong with the ending?
fIt's <i>so</i> depressing! William leaves for Scotland, and Elizabeth ends up with Lord Rathbone? Boo!
hIt's <i>realistic</i>. Sure, their romance is dramatic, but it's not viable, you know? Not for that era.
¹Honey, no one in the audience is going to care about that. What they <i>will</i> care about is being suckered into a compelling romance arc only to have it not pay off in the slightest!
 Hmm... what do you think, {You}?

I think...
*Will and Elizabeth should end up together!
#The sad ending is more interesting.
HI know it's not totally realistic, but it's definitely less of a bummer.
)See? Even your lead actor agrees with me.
:Besides, it's your story. Tell it how you want to tell it.
7Sure, do that... just make sure <i>I</i> can sell it...
4James looks uncertainly to Vasquez, who just shrugs.
AYou wanted to be a writer, James. I guess all I have to say is...
Be careful what you wish for.
.I guess I'll just have to sleep on it for now.
oI'll get back to you, Yasmin. You might have a point... but I'm not sure I'm ready to scrap the current ending.
cFair. Don't wait <i>too</i> long, though... a sad ending is better than a sloppy, last-minute edit.
I'll keep that in mind.
BG_EXT_CAMPUS_QUAD_WINTER_NIGHT
lYou follow James out of Vasquez's office, and the two of you trudge off through the moonlit snow together...
Penny for your thoughts?
!About the ending? I'm not sure...
‚I <i>do</i> want to impress Yasmin, since she could really help my career and everything... but I'm not great at taking criticism.
Really? You?
Shocking, right?
She has a point about giving the audience what they want, but I'm not sure I <i>care</i> what they want. But that could just be my ego talking.
cSounds like quite the conundrum. At least you've still got a few days left to figure it out, right?
BTrue. Maybe I'll write an alternate ending and see how it feels...
lFor now, let's focus on getting ready for opening night. These next few days could pass by pretty quickly...
dThe next few days <i>do</i> pass you by pretty quickly, blending together in a blur of rehearsals...
OThat's it... we're ready. We open tomorrow, folks. Bring everything you've got.

iYou and Kaitlyn catch a bus downtown and pop into a quaint little costume shop called <i>Esmeralda's</i>.
tRows and rows of historic and fairytale costumes line the walls and spill out of large bins under the display racks.
3Wow... there's a lot here... where should we start?
_Kaitlyn bends down to scan the labels on each bin and walks a slow semicircle through the shop.
PLet's see... Roman legion armor? Nope. Sailor Moon cosplay? Unfortunately not...
Here we go! Victorian England!
RYou and Kaitlyn start pulling out costumes and laying them on the display counter.
4Oh my god... this is just what I was hoping to find!
pKaitlyn pulls a bright red soldier's uniform with shiny brass buttons out of the bin and holds it up to herself.

YWhy don't you go try it on? I'll find something for me and meet you by the fitting rooms.

Good answer.
mKaitlyn takes your arm and pulls you into one of the fitting rooms, sliding the curtain closed for privacy...
%Hopefully we don't get interrupted...
I'll try to keep an eye out.
qKaitlyn pulls you closer, her hands gliding over the soft satin of your dress where it hugs tight to your body...
WShe leans in and brushes your lips with hers, teasing you, then whispers in your ear...
JYou're so beautiful, {You}... I just want to rip this dress right off you.
-Better not... I haven't even paid for it yet.
(I'll just have to work around it then...
wShe pushes you back against the wall of the fitting room and kisses you, her hands pinning your wrists to your sides...

What?
rI need to go straight to Vasquez's office from here. I'd rather not look like I just came from... <i>you know</i>.
!So... I shouldn't do <i>this</i>?
TKaitlyn bends down to kiss along your collarbone, her mouth hot on your bare skin...
No...
You don't sound very sure...
4You're going to get me in trouble one of these days.
Kaitlyn takes your chin in her hand and kisses you softly on the lips, then gazes into your eyes for a long second, her expression gentle.
GLet's finish this later, okay? When you're not expected anywhere after.
`That way I can do whatever I want to you without having to worry about getting you in trouble...
\You know when you talk like that it only makes it harder to be responsible and leave, right?

(How should I pose?)
Kiss Kaitlyn!
Give Kaitlyn bunny ears!
Pretend to swoon!

I thought we were done kissing?
1Well, maybe just <i>one</i> more would be okay...

Hey!
JYou lay your satin-gloved hand against your forehead and pretend to swoon.
I've got the vapors!

Oh my god! So cute!
 That dress is incredible, {You}.
Thanks!

(Guess you learn something new every day!
+I'm just gonna take that as a compliment...

y<i>Meeting in an hour. If you're late, I'll assume you're dead and submit a missing persons report. So don't be late.</i>

mI'd better get back to campus... I want to put this costume in my dorm before I have to go deal with Vasquez.
