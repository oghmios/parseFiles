iKaitlyn struggles to keep the shock off her face while Arjun discusses his recent transfer to Hartfeld...
Arjun
èYeah, I'm here to stay. Hartfeld has an amazing anthropology department, <i>and</i> it's close to Northbridge... I figured it'd be a great fit.
HAPPY
Kaitlyn
Yeah, that's... that's great!
	SURPRISED
*You look like I just told you my dog died.
What? Oh, sorry...
SI'm glad you're coming to Hartfeld, really. I just... didn't expect it, that's all.
-Sorry... guess I'm full of surprises tonight.
YI'm gonna step outside for a second... I told my mom I'd check in. You know how she gets.
Right, totally.
?Arjun heads outside, and Kaitlyn turns to you, looking worried.
+Well, this just got a lot more difficult...
SAD
OYou're not actually going to spend all year hiding the truth from him... right?
PWhy not? That's what I did for basically all of middle school and high school...
2Kaitlyn sighs and runs her hands through her hair.
óI mean, part of me is happy he's gonna be around. Cause we <i>are</i> old friends, it's just... we were never close enough for him to know <i>that</i>.
(Well... maybe it's time for him to know.

Because...
NEUTRAL
-You should be able to be yourself around him.
(I think he might have a thing for you...
*I don't know, {You}... I'm just not ready.
~I <i>thought</i> I was ready when I kissed you onstage... but it's easy to be brave when you're playing a character, you know?
AI know what you mean. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pressure you...
Huh?
6You didn't notice? I definitely got a vibe from him...
SThat's crazy. We basically grew up together... I'm sure he doesn't see me that way.
*Besides... I'm just not ready to tell him.
~I <i>thought</i> I was ready when I kissed you onstage... but it's easy to be brave when you're playing a character, you know?
FI know what you mean. I'm sorry if it feels like I'm pressuring you...
No, don't worry about it!
BI'm so glad I can talk to you about this stuff, {You}. It really--

XJust then, Tripp and Logan barrel into the kitchen and yank open your refrigerator door.
7Uh, what are you guys looking for in <i>our</i> fridge?
Tripp
We need your spiciest salsa!
Why, exactly?
Logan
@I'm about to obliterate this fool in a salsa-eating competition.
Madison
I'm the judge!
FRight. I think I see what's going on here. We'll give you three some--
vJust then, Tripp snags a jar off the top shelf of your refrigerator door. The lid flies off, splashing you with salsa!
Tripp, what the hell?!
Oh, crap! Sorry, {You}!
Party foul!
){You}, your clothes! They're all salsa-y!
Yeah, I noticed...
bYou turn to Kaitlyn as Logan and Tripp start furiously devouring the salsa while Madison referees.
 I'm gonna go change. Talk later?

Of course.

LDefinitely an upgrade. Maybe I should thank Tripp for getting salsa on me...
HWell, it's not exactly haute couture, but it's better than salsa stains.
ÜOnce you're cleaned up and changed, you head back into the living room, where Kaitlyn and Arjun are talking and laughing on the couch.

]Kaitlyn turns to look at you, and her eyes go wide, a pink blush spreading across her cheeks.
Wow, {You}...
Like my dress?
7Kaitlyn bites her lip and nods, her expression careful.
Mhmm.
.{You}! That dress looks <i>amazing</i> on you!
Thanks, Kaitlyn.

%Kaitlyn nods, her expression careful.
){You}! That dress looks so pretty on you!
Thanks, Kaitlyn.
You're back!
She pats the seat beside her.
Come sit with us?
1Sure. What were you guys laughing about just now?
wOh, we were just talking about this one time when Arjun and I went to get breakfast tacos at Joe's before school, and--
Wait...
What are breakfast tacos?
I love that place!
+It's basically exactly what it sounds like.
1Wait... you guys don't have breakfast tacos here?
$We have breakfast <i>burritos</i>...
It's not the same.
!They seem pretty similar to me...
 Oh, honey... they're really not.
Right? It's the best!
2Wait... you've been to <i>my</i> Joe's? In Austin?
Uh...
!Yeah, I was just passing through.

Must be a different Joe's.
2Aw, too bad we didn't know each other back then...
Maybe we'll go another time.
Yeah, you should totally visit!
bWe can show you the <i>real</i> Austin. Which <i>definitely</i> includes breakfast tacos at Joe's.
FYeah, I imagine there are a lot of places called Joe's in the world...
LBut <i>our</i> Joe's is the best one. Nothing beats those breakfast tacos...
èAnyway, it's kind of a long story, but it ends with us showing up late to school because we decided to get seconds, and then thirds, and then--
_Oh my god! I totally forgot to tell you this, but I went there <i>again</i> for lunch that day!
What?! Why didn't you take me?
aYou were still a sophomore, dork. Only seniors were allowed to go off-campus for lunch, remember?
Right!

That was <i>such</i> B.S..
ANGRY
|Wow, <i>someone's</i> salty. You should write a letter to Mrs. Barksdale and try to get some justice for future generations.
hNo way... I'm <i>still</i> scared of her. Those crazy long nails of hers could do some serious damage...
^Arjun bursts out laughing, then takes another sip of his beer, a reminiscent gleam in his eye.
2He notices you looking lost and clears his throat.
MSorry, I feel like we're totally boxing you out of the conversation, {You}...
No, it's fine...
{How about this... what do you like best about Kaitlyn? Cause honestly I'm <i>still</i> trying to find a reason to like her.
 <i>Wow,</i> you are such a jerk!

Well, I really like her...
Personality.
	Massages.
Lips.
:She's super sweet, and she really cares about her friends.
<i>And</i> she's a lot of fun.

Aw, {You}!
 I <i>think</i> I can see that...
-But it'd help if we spent more time together.
KOh, yeah... I'm sure we will? Especially now that we're both at Hartfeld...
{You}!
&Massages, huh? I'll keep that in mind.
IUh, I wouldn't get your hopes up... {You} is just trying to embarrass me.
{You}!
SIs that so? I guess that play gave you plenty of opportunity to find out firsthand.
UI'm sure there were more than a couple guys feeling pretty jealous in the audience...
Including you?
I didn't say that...
#Let's... talk about something else.
Like, anything else.
PAfter a while, Arjun gets up to get another drink, and you turn to face Kaitlyn.
CIt's obvious that he likes you. Don't act like you don't notice it.
5I... I don't know... maybe he does, maybe he doesn't.
`I don't think it's as 'obvious' as you seem to think... but what exactly do you expect me to do?
Tell him that...
You're just not interested.
You're not into guys.
You're taken.
SWell, what if he doesn't <i>actually</i> like me, and I just come out and say that?
I'll look like an idiot.
But he <i>does</i> like you.
$You know I'm not ready to do that...
GWell, you might have to. You don't want him to get his hopes up, right?
>I mean... no, I don't. But I'm not even convinced he likes me.
Relationship Improved
0Your relationship with Kaitlyn will be affected.
3Am I? We haven't <i>really</i> defined, well, 'us.'
Maybe we should.
:I think I'd like that... but let's not talk about it here.
<That's a conversation that requires a little more privacy...
,Am I? We haven't really had that talk yet...
Maybe we should.
xI'd like that... but we should probably save that conversation for when we're somewhere a little more... <i>private.</i>
;I... I am? I wasn't sure you felt that strongly about us...
!What do you mean? Of course I do!
:Well, you could definitely make that a bit more obvious...
bBut let's talk about it later. That type of conversation usually requires a little more privacy...
PI'll try to be patient. But in the meantime... what are you going to tell Arjun?
IUm... nothing? Honestly, I'm not super convinced that he even likes me...
But he <i>does</i> like you.
_We don't <i>know</i> that. Look, if he says anything more definite... maybe I'll tell him then.
9For now... it's kind of nice having him back as a friend.
+I know... I just hope <i>he</i> knows that.
ÄKaitlyn glances over to the kitchen where Arjun's leaning against the counter with a freshly opened beer, looking a little lost.
pWell, I'm gonna go talk to him. He doesn't know anyone here, so I kinda feel like I should keep him entertained.
dAnd if he makes a move or says anything <i>too</i> flirty... I'll tell him I'm not available. Happy?
I suppose...
ZKaitlyn gets up from the couch and walks over to Arjun, who brightens up when he sees her.
"Guess I'd better make my rounds...

dYou head up to the roof to find James sipping his drink and staring distractedly at the party-goers.
Something on your mind?

.He turns to look at you, and his words falter.
James
{You}, you look... incredible.
No need to sound so surprised.
1Yeah, I guess I should be used to it by now, huh?
Nice recovery.
Relationship Improved
.Your relationship with James will be affected.
.He turns to look at you, and his eyes go wide.
&Wow, {You}... that dress is beautiful.
LOh, this old thing? <pause/>Okay, I guess it's <i>technically</i> brand new.
3The dress may be new, but you are a classic beauty.
(Aw, stop. You're going to make me blush.
A few things, actually.
BA frustratingly cryptic answer. I guess I should've expected that.
(James smiles but still seems distracted.
$So... why are you up here all alone?
(I'm just trying to... figure it all out.
What do you mean?
Well, I never really considered that my play would make it to the stage, much less with a major literary agent in the audience.
7I mean... what if Yasmin doesn't offer to represent me?
What if she <i>does</i> and wants me to make <i>more</i> script changes to adapt it for a film? What if I'm not ready for this?
?You're totally ready. I mean, look at what you've done already!
iNot only did you <i>write</i> an incredible play, you put it all together to perform in a matter of days.
D{You}, you know that I can't take <i>all</i> of the credit for that.
{And you shouldn't. But you should remember that when you feel like you aren't ready or that things are becoming too much...
0There will always be people that have your back.
aYou're right. If Yasmin decides to take me on, I'll be ready for it. No matter what happens next.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_ACTION_FUN
3You mean <i>when</i> Yasmin decides to take you on.

I think...

Our play turned out great!
You're an amazing writer!
You're irresistible!
<i>Our</i> play?
KUh, <i>yeah</i>. I think at this point I can take a teensy bit of credit...
#Like a share of stock or something.
9Funny... I don't remember signing a contract or anything.
QWell... I'll settle for the satisfaction of singlehandedly launching your career.
2<i>Assuming</i> it gets off the runway, of course.
dYou saw the audience. We got a standing ovation. There's no way Yasmin won't take that into account.
(I really hope you're right. And {You}...
Thanks for believing in me.
0I appreciate the pep talk, but I'm really not...
EOh my god, enough with the false modesty. Just admit you're talented!
JOkay... maybe there were one or two good lines in that play. <i>Maybe</i>.
You're hopeless.
Relationship Improved
.Your relationship with James will be affected.
4You're talented, charming, and <i>insanely</i> sexy.
.<i>Of course</i> she'll want to work with you.
9But if she tries anything... she'll have to answer to me.
&I'm glad you feel so protective of me.
éJames bends to kiss you, leaving the lingering taste of scotch on your lips. He takes your hand and places a gentle kiss across your knuckles.
"Thanks for believing in me, {You}.
"Am I detecting a hint of jealousy?
5I don't think I've ever seen this side of you, {You}.
'I just don't like to share, that's all.
@James laughs and leans down to place a gentle kiss on your lips.
0Neither do I. Thanks for believing in me, {You}.
Are you... jealous?
@I have to say, I'm a little surprised. Flattered, but surprised.
_I guess after working so closely together on this play, I'm starting to see you in a new light.
UAnd in that light, I can see that Yasmin would be crazy not to want to represent you.
ëJames smiles, reaching up to tuck a piece of hair behind your ear. His fingers tickle your neck as his hand slides down to rest on your shoulder.
"Thanks for believing in me, {You}.
5James looks down and notices that his glass is empty.
5I think I'll get myself another drink. Need anything?
LI'm good for now, but I'll head in with you. It is <i>freezing</i> out here.
aBack inside, you spot Chris and Darren laughing quietly in the corner and walk over to join them.
Relationship Improved
.Your relationship with Chris will be affected.
chris
Chris
Wow, {You}... that dress!
Yeah? What about it?
Darren
QI think what Chris is <i>trying</i> to say... is that you look beautiful tonight.
Yeah! What he said.
6Thanks, Chris. And thanks for the translation, Darren.
Relationship Improved
.Your relationship with Chris will be affected.
*You weren't wearing that before, were you?
$Yeah... had a little salsa incident.
?Chris presses his hands together and raises them up in the air.
Thank you salsa!
(Aw, stop. You're going to make me blush.
*You weren't wearing that before, were you?
$Yeah... had a little salsa incident.

Happens to the best of us.
.So what were you guys laughing about just now?
See for yourself...
òHe points to the hallway where Becca has Sebastian cornered. She twirls a piece of hair around her finger and laughs prettily at something he just said.
7Yikes. That's a match made in hell if I ever saw one...
3Right? Chris <i>claims</i> it doesn't bother him...
Why would it?

Because...
You used to date?
 She almost sucked out your soul?
You ditched her for me?
%Or did you totally forget about that?
QEr, no. I didn't forget exactly, it's just I never really considered it dating...
;<i>And</i> I think that's as far as this conversation goes.
B{You}, have you seen Logan? He said he'd bring back a beer for me.
^I bet if you'd have stayed with her any longer, you would have come back an empty Chris shell.
Ouch! That was ice cold, {You}.
2Can we talk about, you know, <i>anything</i> else?
MI've been enjoying my Becca-free lifestyle, and I'd like to keep it that way.
RLet's talk about how Logan said he'd bring me a beer and then totally disappeared.
Relationship Improved
.Your relationship with Chris will be affected.
%Or did you totally forget about that?
CNo, I didn't forget. I just wouldn't exactly... phrase it that way.
&Have I apologized for that by the way?
9You may have once or twice, but I never say no to thirds.
eChris grins and takes your hand, raising it to his lips and pressing a gentle kiss over your fingers.

I'm sorry.
$I wouldn't say no to fourths either.
=Chris leans over and kisses you for a long, lingering moment.
)Uh, guys, I'm still sitting right here...
,{You}, I'm really sorry about all that mess.
.It's <i>mostly</i> all in the past. Besides...
9You're with <i>me</i> now. So, it all kind of worked out.
PChris leans over and gives you a long, lingering kiss. Darren clears his throat.
.Uh, guys, don't forget you have an audience...
0You know I'm really sorry about all that, right?
[It's okay, it's all in the past now. Besides, we weren't <i>really</i> serious then anyway.
!Does that mean we're serious now?
We're... getting there.
7Chris grins, leaning over to give you a lingering kiss.
6I'm starting to feel a little like a third-wheel here.
Chris glances up and grimaces.
"Oh crap, they're coming over here.
zSebastian strides over to the table with Becca in tow. He gives you all a dazzling smile before his gaze settles on Chris.
	Sebastian
hChristopher, just wanted to give my congratulations for your excellent work in James' little production.
Uh, just Chris is fine...
JYour charisma and stage presence rival many thespians I've performed with.
eWhich is why I think you'd make an excellent vice president for my upcoming student council campaign.
	Me, a VP?
Becca
3You're asking <i>Chris</i> to be your running mate?
1Yo, Chris! Did I just hear you're running for VP?
.He hands Darren one of the beers he's holding.
Yay! How exciting!
II just thought if you ever ran, we'd run together. Bros for life, y'know.
ULogan, this is the first time I've ever heard you say <i>anything</i> about politics.
kNot that Chris has ever shown any interest either. Why <i>Chris</i>, Sebastian? You barely know each other.
3You know, I find myself wondering the same thing...
/We've shared a stage. There is no greater bond.
PWith my keen mind for politics and Chris's golden boy appeal, we're unstoppable.
UWell... that's certainly a tempting offer. Can I have a little time to think it over?
CAbsolutely, but make it quick. I'll have to begin campaigning soon.
Now, do you have any prior experience with political office? A turn on student council, perhaps? Where did you go to school before Hartfeld?
(Uh... Cherryfield High? It's in Maine...
aI thought Foxcroft was the only prep school of note in Maine... Cherryfield isn't ringing a bell.
6Oh, well that's probably because it's a public school.
KSebastian's eyes go wide with horror, then he starts laughing uproariously.

MUSIC_COLLEGE_TENSE_ACTION
What's so funny?
NIt's just... the all-American boy with such humble beginnings, it's so quaint.
.Hey, there's nothing wrong with public school.
Ah, <i>sure</i> there's not.
 Sebastian, I think you should...
Leave.

Apologize.
There's the door.
(My apologies, I didn't mean to offend...
1His smile twitches, like he's holding in a laugh.
7Whether you meant it or not, <i>I'm</i> taking offense.
,It's okay {You}, I can fight my own battles.
MJust say you're sorry now, before you say something that makes it even worse.
-Why should he? All he did was tell the truth.
JWhat, that going to some fancy private school makes him better than Chris?
?Just look at Sebastian! He's smart, sophisticated, ambitious...
And super rich!
@No, {You} is right, I should apologize. Chris, I'm very sorry...
`That you had to attend a mediocre public school and ended up with an equally mediocre education.
CYou literally ended up at the same college, genius. Open your eyes.
aAnd if public school is outside of your demographic, you're gonna be hard-pressed to find voters.
2They call it the ninety-nine percent for a reason.
-Thanks, guys, but I can fight my own battles.
}Don't worry Chris, your stint in the public school system won't affect our campaign... assuming we can find a way to spin it.
*Chris pushes back his chair and stands up.
uYou know what? You can stop saying <i>our</i> campaign... because as of right now, you're officially running opposed.
What?
1You heard me. I don't need to be your poster boy.
!I'm running for president myself.
.<i>Ohh!</i> My man Chris coming for the title!
RThere's a beat of silence, then Sebastian starts laughing even louder than before.
"Oh that is <i>truly</i> hilarious.
There's nothing funny about it.
"Sebastian, I think he's serious...
5Serious or not, there's no way he'd actually beat me.
Just wait and see.
wYou, Darren, Logan, and Chris glare at Becca and Sebastian. Sebastian gazes back with a placid smile still on his face.
What are we looking at?
*Come on, Sebastian, let's get out of here.
2I have a sudden desire to be <i>anywhere</i> else.
Let me just get my coat.
}Becca slips her arm around Sebastian's waist and turns him away. Sebastian glances back over his shoulder and winks at Chris.
@When you realize that all of this is a lost cause, come find me.
9He and Becca grab their coats and walk out into the cold.
That was <i>tense!</i>
MFor real. But hell yeah, President Chris! We gotta celebrate, man. Rage cage?

You know I'd never say no.
Alright! We'll set it up.
1Darren claps Chris on the shoulder as he gets up.
Can I play?
Of course! Do you know how?
Does anyone really?
yYou and Chris move away from the table so they can set up the cups. Chris shoves his hands into the pockets of his jeans.
Are you okay?
(Yeah, it's just been kinda crazy lately.
KYeah, I guess it has. So, are you really going to do it? Run for president?
dYou know, I think I am. Why not? I wanna show people like Sebastian that I'm not <i>just</i> a jock.

Think I got what it takes?
Hmm...
Totally. No question.
$Sebastian seems pretty formidable...
You'll wipe the floor with him.
Thanks, {You}.
MHe's all talk. Besides... the guy's not about to win any popularity contests.
9So that's what elections are to you? Popularity contests?
<Well, by definition... yeah, that's basically what they are.
 Guess I can't argue with that...
,Yo Prez! Where you at? Games about to start!
CI guess that's my cue. I'll see you later. Unless you want to play?
<Hmm... I think I'll pass this time. I'll be rooting for you!
ÕYou make your way across the room to where Abbie and Tyler stand against the wall, watching the game of rage cage. Tyler whispers something in her ear, and the corner of Abbie's mouth quirks up in a smile.
Oh, sorry... Am I interrupting?
Abbie
aNo, not at all! Tyler was telling me the mathematical probability of winning a game of rage cage.
Yeah? What's the outcome?
Tyler
FInconclusive, since no one <i>really</i> understands the rules anyway.
|You look over at the table where Chris, Darren, Logan, and Tripp are banging their fists on the table chanting, 'rage cage.'
That sounds about right.
"Oh, I'm dry. I gotta get a refill.
No, let me! I'll be right back.
pTyler takes Abbie's cup and starts toward the kitchen. Tripp grabs him and pulls him into the game of rage cage.
*Guess that refill's going to take a while.
âHow are things going with you and Tyler? You guys are so cute, and you seem really happy. Tell me all about it, don't leave anything out!
MI'm not sure how much there is to tell since we only recently started dating.
<But I really like Tyler, and we're figuring it out together.
}She looks over at Tyler, staring at the whirr of cups and balls in front of him with an expression of sheer panic. She grins.
ZI guess we're still figuring out how we work together, but so far, I'm liking the journey.
6Abbie... that's so sweet! You two are the <i>best</i>.
YQuit it, {You}, you're gonna make me blush. But, speaking of, how's your love life going?
MUSIC_COLLEGE_LOVE
crush_choice
You mean, me and...
Chris?
Kaitlyn?
James?
_Honestly, I'm not really sure. Things are definitely going better than they were before, but...
6We haven't really talked about where things are going.
$That's not weird is it? Is it weird?
CIt's not weird at all! Especially with the history between you two.
<But Chris is adorable, and I know he really cares about you.
IYou guys make the <i>cutest</i> couple. That is, if you are a couple... ?
OYou look over to the table where Logan and Chris face off over their last cups.
Let me get back to you on that.
Go get him, {You}!
ÅYou give her a nod, and then head over to the table where they're re-setting the rage cage cups. You walk straight over to Chris.
+Hey, how'd it go? Are you king of the cage?
Y'know... I'm not really sure.
jYeah, I've been hearing that a lot about this game. I guess that means you can be the king if you want to.
/Yeah, I guess it does. Okay then, I'm the king!
MTonight is going great for me. First, I was the first lady, now, I'm a queen.
KQueen, first lady, doesn't matter to me as long as I'm the one on your arm.
OYou feel your pulse quicken and you think back to your conversation with Abbie.
GChris, can we talk for a second? It's something kind of... important...
ôLooks like it's time for you and Chris to have 'the talk!' Will you define the relationship... or leave things as they are? Find out in the next chapter!
]We're really great together, but things got a little more complicated once Arjun showed up...
úKaitlyn still isn't out to everyone back home, including him. So it's like... I want to respect her wishes and help her work through this in her own time...
cBut I'm also worried that having Arjun around will mean we can't be as... obvious as we used to be.
hI'm sorry, {You}... I know it's rough, but I know Kaitlyn really appreciates you being patient with her.
ÑYou guys have been so close since day one, and I know there's nothing that could come between you. You'll get through this together.
8Thanks, Abbie... it's actually really nice to hear that.
cI get the feeling it'd be really nice for Kaitlyn to hear it, too. Maybe you should go talk to her?
uYou look over to the bar where Kaitlyn is mixing up cocktails for Zack and Brandon, Arjun watching over her shoulder.
I think I will.
^You sidle up to Kaitlyn and take her hand in yours, below the counter where Arjun can't see...
Hey.
Hey...
0There's something I want to talk to you about...
Something... important.
õLooks like it's time for you and Kaitlyn to have 'the talk!' Will you define the relationship... or leave things as they are? Find out in the next chapter!
VHonestly, I'm not really sure. James has always been pretty reserved and mysterious...
]But lately it seems like he's really opening up, especially after the thing with his parents.
CI guess we just haven't really talked about where things are going.
$That's not weird is it? Is it weird?
cNot at all! You and James have been through a lot but you're still just getting to know each other.
FJames is so handsome and polite, and I know he really cares about you.
IYou guys make the <i>cutest</i> couple. That is, if you are a couple... ?
8You look around the suite, but don't see James anywhere.
@Let me get back to you on that. You haven't seen James have you?
/Just then, Tyler appears, two red cups in hand.
