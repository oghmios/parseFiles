The Freshman
You

BG_INT_DORM_MAIN_NIGHT
rYou stand in front of Chris in the crowded kitchen. Logan brushes past you with a teetering stack of plastic cups.
GChris, can we talk for a second? It's something kind of... important...
Chris
4Uh, yeah, of course. Should we go somewhere quieter?
	SURPRISED
iYou and Chris grab your coats off the nearby rack. Chris takes your hand and leads you up to the rooftop.
 BG_EXT_DORM_ROOFTOP_WINTER_NIGHT
 Wow, it's weirdly empty up here.
?Yeah, people probably couldn't handle the snow and went inside.
HAPPY
That's probably true...
NEUTRAL
But I love the snow!
'I'm starting to regret coming out here.
Seriously, I can't get enough.
LYou lift your face up and watch the snowflakes drift lazily through the air.
 They're like tiny falling stars.
BChris grins and takes you by the waist, pulling you closer to him.
You are so beautiful, {You}.
 Seriously, it's <i>freezing!</i>
SAD
BChris grins and takes you by the waist, pulling you closer to him.
'Don't worry, {You}, I'll keep you warm.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_LOVE
EHe presses a soft kiss to your lips, and warmth radiates through you.
)I could stay out here with you all night.
IYou wrap your arms around his neck and pull him back in for another kiss.
^I would stay with you anywhere you wanted to be... but we did come up here to talk, didn't we?
Yeah, thanks for reminding me.
@So... this talk. Should I brace myself, or is this a happy talk?
Uh, hopefully the second one.
òI was talking to Abbie, and it kind of got me thinking about where we're going. I guess I'm wondering... have you thought about our relationship at all?
>Of course I have. I know we went through a lot last quarter...
chris
3But honestly, I think we're stronger because of it.
9Chris cups your cheek with his hand, smiling down at you.
uAnd there's no one else I would rather be with. I really think... I think I'm really starting to fall for you, {You}.
"But it all worked out okay. Right?
=Chris looks down at you, a shy smile playing across his lips.
vI'm really happy with you, {You}, and I can't say for certain what's going to happen, but I can see a future with you.
iIf I'm totally honest, I wasn't sure we'd ever get to this point. Having a talk just like this, you know?
MBut I'm happy that we are... I can really see this relationship going places.
NAll this time, even with all the Becca stuff, I've only wanted to be with you.
That's nice to hear.
&Chris smiles and kisses your forehead.
[{You}... you can just say the word, and I swear, I'm all yours. I'm ready whenever you are.
Chris...

I'm ready.

I need a little more time.
Making it Official
$You and Chris are officially dating!
%So, we're making this thing official?
>I guess so. Does this mean I can call you my <i>boyfriend?</i>
(Only if I get to call you my girlfriend.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_COMEDY_MISCHIEF
4And of course, we can't forget the cutesy pet names!
[Cutesy pet names? I've always liked the kind of generic ones. You know, like babe or sugar.
[That's too boring for us. I was thinking more along the lines of snugglepuss or schnookums.
What about honey or baby?
0Ooh, I could call you my little snuggle sausage.
$Uh, well... if I have to pick one...
$Chris, I'm totally messing with you.
`Oh man, I am so relieved. I don't think snuggle sausage would have gone over well with the team.
5I'm just not sure I'm ready for the commitment yet...
êSay no more. I completely understand. I'm just happy that you're giving me another chance, and we can take it as slow or as fast as you want to.
0He presses a warm, gentle kiss to your forehead.
I'll wait as long as it takes.
=Thanks, Chris. I appreciate how cool you're being about this.
aI still want to be with you, I just don't know if I want to <i>call</i> it anything specific yet.
SHeh, I kind of went through the same questions myself last quarter if you remember.
YOh, I remember. The whole {You} and Chris will-they-won't-they drama was driving me nuts!
1Well, you won't have to worry about that anymore.
!Should we head back to the party?
AChris wraps his arms around you, squeezing your body against his.
Mmm... not just yet.
=Good thing it's not like <i>snowing</i> out here or anything.
nChris gives you a devilish grin. He steals a kiss before nudging your head to the side and exposing your neck.
"Is it snowing? I can't even tell..
LHe trails a line of gentle kisses down your throat, making your toes tingle.
#I'm definitely starting to warm up.
Starting to?
9He lifts you up, and you wrap your legs around his waist.
*What do you say we take this to your room?
Chris...
"You can take me anywhere you want.
party_chris
Let's save it for another time.
#I'm officially putty in your hands.
2Meaning I can mold you into whatever shape I want?
;Whoa there, boy, let's save the dirty talk for the bedroom.
#Should I carry you back downstairs?
LThat does sound nice, but there <i>is</i> still a party going on. I'll walk.
IChris sets you down gently. You take his hand and pull him to the stairs.
BG_INT_DORM_BEDROOM_NIGHT
bYou dodge past the partygoers downstairs and lock your bedroom door once you and Chris are inside.
!We <i>are</i> hosting this party.
Yeah, I guess you have a point.
_I promise we'll pick this up another time. Especially if you pick <i>me</i> up like this again.
$You give him a long, lingering kiss.
AMaybe I should just carry you everywhere. Need a lift downstairs?
You can put me down. For now.
DChris sets you down gently. You move to walk away, but he stops you.
#{You}, just promise me one thing...
Sure.
[Promise me that when the time comes... you'll help me defend my title as king of Rage Cage.
'He grins, and you can't help but laugh.
>Hey, I've gotten used to being queen. The crown stays with us.
HYou lead Kaitlyn to your bedroom and close the door softly behind you...
UKaitlyn pushes you up against it, her lips already finding yours in the semidarkness.
1<i>Kaitlyn</i>, I said I wanted to <i>talk</i>...
eKaitlyn starts kissing your neck, her mouth moving eagerly against your bare skin. You stifle a gasp.
Kaitlyn
#Are you sure you just want to talk?
I... y-yes...
For now, at least.
0Kaitlyn pulls away and looks quizzically at you.
*Is this a good kind of talk or a bad kind?
MUSIC_COLLEGE_LOVE_SAD
+A good kind. At least, <i>I</i> think so...
ÉKaitlyn eases off you, and the two of you cross the room to sit on the edge of your bed together. You take Kaitlyn's hand in yours.
XI just... I wanted to check in with you. Things have gotten pretty complicated lately...
And...
!I'm worried you're ashamed of us.
 I feel a bit jealous of Arjun...
9How can you say that? I'm not... <i>ashamed</i>, I just--
QAre you sure? I mean, you definitely don't seem to want Arjun to know about us...
aI... I know. And I'm sorry. I wish that I could be braver for you. But I just... can't right now.
INot yet, at least. And I wish I was the only one affected by this, but...
OYou're not. I know. I guess I'm just worried that he's gonna come between us...
Jealous? Of <i>Arjun?</i>
MYou guys have all this history... and I just met you, like, a few months ago.
MIt's a lot to compete with. I know you're not <i>attracted</i> to him, but...
;{You}... I can be friends with Arjun and still be with you.
2Can you, though? It seems like you <i>can't</i>...
kaitlyn
=I'm sorry, {You}. I know it's been weird with Arjun around...
KBut you have nothing to worry about. I wouldn't give this up for the world.
;Kaitlyn leans over and presses a gentle kiss to your cheek.
CYou're the best thing that's ever happened to me, {You}. I mean it.
[I know it's been weird with Arjun around... but you have to know how much I care about you.
AI wish I knew a way to tell you that would make you believe me...
;Kaitlyn leans over and presses a gentle kiss to your cheek.
That's not a bad start...
Oh yeah?
RLook, I know it's been weird with Arjun around... but I don't know what I can say.
I care about you, {You}. A lot.
;Kaitlyn leans over and presses a gentle kiss to your cheek.
&I just... I wish you would believe me.
lYou look down at Kaitlyn's hand in your lap and run your thumb along hers, slightly afraid to meet her eyes.
 Kaitlyn... I've been thinking...
fWe haven't really figured out... what we are, exactly. And... right now feels like a pretty good time.
dKaitlyn takes your chin in her hand and forces you to meet her eyes. Her voice drops to a whisper...
*Are you saying what I think you're saying?

Kaitlyn...
I want you to be my girlfriend.
'I want things to stay the way they are.
Making it Official
&You and Kaitlyn are officially dating!
\A bright, happy smile spreads over Kaitlyn's face, and you feel yourself blushing furiously.
Say that again.
$Kaitlyn! Just say yes or no already!
'Why do <i>I</i> have to say it, anyway?
4Cause you're the one with the huge crush on me, duh.
EYou bury your face in your hands and collapse backward onto your bed.
<i>Stopppp</i> teasing me...
sKaitlyn rolls over on top of you and pulls your hands away from your face, leaning close so her lips brush yours...
	Say it...

Kaitlyn...

Will you be my girlfriend?
/Let's skip to the part where you're kissing me.
9Kaitlyn props herself up on her elbow, stroking her chin.
(Hmm, I might have to think about this...
Oh my god, quit torturing me!
DKaitlyn leans down to steal a kiss, her eyes shining with happiness.
"Of course I'll be your girlfriend.
4Sorry... I don't kiss people unless I'm dating them.
Since when?

Since now.
6Kaitlyn bites her lip, her eyes dancing with laughter.
7It's not fair that <i>I</i> have to ask <i>twice</i>...
Oh, all right...
UKaitlyn leans down to whisper in your ear, and you hear the happiness in her voice...
#{You}... will you be my girlfriend?
3You press a kiss to her cheek, then whisper back...
Of course I will.
sYou smile and suppress a shiver as Kaitlyn traces a finger down your side, letting it idle playfully on your hip...
8Kaitlyn's face falls slightly, but she recovers herself.
Oh... okay.
Are you... upset?
2Kaitlyn thinks for a moment, then shakes her head.
NI'm not upset. I know that... things are a little up in the air at the moment.
FAnd I understand if you're not totally ready to make this... official.
XTo be honest, I'm not sure if <i>I</i> am. There's still so much I need to figure out...
PAnd I'll be there to help you. Besides... we have plenty of fun as it is, right?
Right.
tKaitlyn leans close and kisses you softly on the lips. You kiss her back, letting her push you down onto your bed...
What are you up to?
Oh, nothing...
0Unless you <i>want</i> me to be up to something.
QYou bite your lip as Kaitlyn leans down to kiss your neck again, soft and slow...
I want you to...
Do whatever you want to me.
party_kaitlyn
Just kiss me for now.
I can do that.
gKaitlyn rests her hand on your chest and presses a kiss to your lips, her hair falling down around you.
PYou part your lips and find Kaitlyn's tongue with yours, making her moan softly.
#Make some room. I want to hold you.
sYou scoot over on the bed so Kaitlyn can lie down beside you, kissing her again as she wraps her arms around you...
This is nice.
1I know... I wish we could stay like this forever.
BMe too. But... we probably shouldn't stay in here <i>too</i> long.
_True... I suppose this <i>is</i> a cast party, and we're a pretty important part of the cast...
!We can pick this up another time.
Promise?
Promise.
NYou stand on the roof of your dorm in front of James as snow falls around you.
_James... there's actually something I wanted to talk to you about. It's kind of... important...
James
4Of course. You can talk to me about anything, {You}.
ãThere's a moment of silence while you try to find the words you want to say. You look up at the snowflakes drifting lazily through the air.
?'A little snow was here and there, disseminated in her hair...'
Poetry? Something you wrote?
YEmily Dickinson. Though I could swear it was written for you. Snowflakes really suit you.
%He wipes a snowflake from your cheek.
Poetry in a snow flurry?
How romantic!
How cheesy!
4You really know how to sweep a girl off of her feet.
ÜI think the credit really goes to Emily Dickinson for that one. But, if you liked that, I've got a whole repertoire of classic poetry.
Aw, was it that bad?
KI'm just teasing. I mean, it <i>was</i> cheesy. But it was still beautiful.
FJust wait, I've got a whole repertoire of classic poetry just like it.
ÑJames pulls you in close. He kisses you, gently at first, and then more deeply. Warmth spreads through your body, down to your toes.
#<i>Wow.</i> What's gotten into you?
3Scotch would be my guess. That's a good wow, right?
NYou wrap your arms around James' neck and pull him back down for another kiss.
ÖI'll take that as a yes... I could stay out here kissing you all night, but you <i>did</i> want to talk about something, did you not?
Thanks for the reminder.
%So... this talk. Should I be worried?
jNot at all. It's just... I was talking to Abbie inside, and she got me thinking about where this is going.
MI guess I'm just wondering... have you thought about our relationship at all?
james
FOf course! You've been there for me at times when no one else would...
@And now it's kind of hard to imagine you <i>not</i> being there.
FOf course! You're the most honest, supportive, beautiful woman I know.
OHow lucky am I to have someone like that in my corner? Someone like <i>you.</i>
SI have thought about it a bit. All I know for sure is that I love being around you.
JI'm not sure what the future holds for me, but I definitely see you in it.
eJames pulls you into a hug. You nestle into the warmth of his chest, your head tucked under his chin.
âYou know, {You}, I've always believed my writing to be the most important thing in my life. But I'm starting to see things differently...
!Are you saying I'm a distraction?
ëThe best kind. There's something special about you. I haven't been able to get you out of my head since the day you walked into Vasquez's office.
dI don't want to be with anyone but you. Just say the word, and I'm all yours, whenever you're ready.
James...

I'm ready.
I need more time...
Making it Official
$You and James are officially dating.
8James pulls back and looks deep into your eyes, smiling.
=I don't need any more time. I know what I want, and it's you.
@Look how far we've come... from fake fiancee to real girlfriend.
Girlfriend?
Yeah. If that's okay?
SYes, you can call me your girlfriend. All the time. In fact, tell everyone you see.
ETrust me, I will. Though... can we make just one agreement right now?
What's that?
No pet names.
ÉYou can't be serious. That's practically the whole reason to get into a relationship. <i>No</i> pet names? Not even Kitten Pickles?
4Why is that the <i>first</i> one that comes to mind?
...I'll accept Darling.
mEw! Okay, why don't we just stick with boyfriend or girlfriend and let the cutesy nicknames happen naturally.
Sounds fair to me.
ÄOf course, I still want to be with you, it's just... this is still really new, and I haven't even finished my freshman year yet.
RI don't know if I'm ready for the labels or the <i>pressure</i> of a relationship.
%Say no more. I completely understand.
You do?
…Of course. You're barely hanging on to your scholarship, you've got Vasquez breathing down your neck every second, and even with all of that, you're handling freshman year <i>way</i> better than I did.
3I find that hard to believe. You're so... together.
ÉYeah, <i>now.</i> But when I was a freshman, I was so torn between what my father wanted me to be and what <i>I</i> wanted to be...
_It drove me crazy until I finally made my choice. I don't want to be the one to make you crazy.
:I'll wait until you're ready. <pause/>As long as it takes.
nYou stretch up on your toes and bring your lips to his, savoring the warmth of the kiss in the cold night air.
[As you're about to pull away, James draws you even closer, squeezing your body against his.
{You}...
We should...
Head to my room.
party_james
Go back to the party.
I was hoping you'd say that.
ãHe kisses you again, lifting you off of your feet as he pulls you in. When you come up for air, he trails a line of kisses across your jaw.
Well, this is new.
EYou haven't seen all of my tricks, {You}... at least, not <i>yet</i>.
?His hands travel slowly down your back, making your knees weak.
Yeah? When will I?
>Oh, very soon I'd imagine. I'm feeling... adventurous tonight.
^Suddenly, James dips you backward and continues his trail of kisses down to your collarbone...
How do <i>you</i> feel?
\I feel like if it wasn't snowing out here I'd be naked already. My room, now, <i>please?</i>
 Well, since you asked so nicely.
DHe draws you back upright and smiles as he releases his hold on you.
,Whoa, that dip made me a little lightheaded.

Don't worry, I've got you.
PJames wraps an arm around you and leads you back through the party to your room.
/Before we get a little <i>too</i> carried away.
Are you sure?
YHe nuzzles his face into the side of your neck, planting soft kisses just below your ear.
sWell, I <i>was</i>... <pause/>No, we should get back in there. You're the man of the hour. We can't just disappear.
+I suppose you're right. Another time maybe?
6As long as we pick up <i>right</i> where you left off.
You mean right... here?
@He gives you a playful bite right where he had been kissing you.
9That's the spot! Now come on, stop trying to distract me.
4James pulls back and grins at you, taking your hand.
Alright, let's go.
8Hand in hand, you and James head back down to the party.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_ACTION_FUN
≠The music gets louder and louder as you walk back into the living room. Zack has his phone plugged into a set of speakers and is playing something with a thumping bass beat.
Zack
!Let's turn this party up a notch!
 Yes! This song is my <i>jam!</i>
Madison
7{You}, can we move this table to make room for dancing?
Tripp
	I got it!
Logan
Not if I get it first!
OTripp and Logan each grab an end of the table and start a tug-of-war over it...
.Come on, man, we can't <i>both</i> carry it...
ANGRY
&Which is why <i>you</i> should let go!
pTheir argument is interrupted by a sharp rap on the door. Both Logan and Tripp drop the table with a heavy thud.
2Uh oh. We're probably being <i>way</i> too loud...
MZack turns the music down as you head for the door. You open it cautiously...
So sorry about the noise, I--

MUSIC_COLLEGE_ACTION_CHILL
Professor Vasquez?!
nVasquez stands in your doorway with Yasmin just behind him. He holds an expensive looking bottle in his hands.
Professor...
What are you doing here?
Are you lost?
Is that wine for me?
Vasquez
+Is that how you welcome all of your guests?
0Aren't guests normally people you <i>invite?</i>
2An awkward silence hangs between you for a moment.
8Er, sorry. You're right, that was rude of me. I'm sorry.
Apology accepted.
&...So, what <i>are</i> you doing here?
>Vasquez looks uncomfortable. Yasmin steps out from behind him.
Yasmin
JI thought it might be nice to come congratulate you all on your hard work.
No, we were just leaving.
hHe turns on his heel, but Yasmin stops him. She crosses her arms across her chest and raises an eyebrow.
Fine.
wNo, {You}, we're not lost. Yasmin thought it might be... nice, if we came by to congratulate you all on your hard work.
$So, you came to see your star pupil?
UJames is talented, surely, but I don't know if I'd call him a <i>star</i> just yet...
I was talking about me.
SI should think <i>not.</i> This is a '99 Chateau-Branaire Ducru St-Julien Bordeaux.
!I understood some of those words.
Yasmin nudges Vasquez forward.
<Yes, well. It's a very good wine, perfect for celebrating...
XI thought it might be a nice idea to come by and congratulate you all on your hard work.
So... do you want to come in?
FVasquez looks to Yasmin for the answer, and she gives him a harsh nod.
Yes.

Okay then.
'You open the door to let them past you.
#Thanks for your hospitality, {You}.
yAll of your friends freeze in place as Vasquez and Yasmin enter. For the first time since you met, Vasquez looks nervous.
.{You}, why are all the children staring at me?
;Er, we thought you were the RA, so we got a little spooked.
kAh, well, clearly I am <i>not</i> your RA. So, please return to your evening as though I weren't even here.
+You heard the man! Let's turn it <i>up!</i>
|Zack turns the music back up, while Chris and Logan start pouring more drinks. You lead Vasquez and Yasmin into the kitchen.
`You can put your wine down here... there should be some glasses on the top shelf of the cabinet.
lYasmin grabs a wine glass. She pours herself a glass of the Bordeaux that Vasquez brought and smiles at you.
GDon't worry about him. He's surrounded by material, he'll be just fine.
IOh, I'm just glad I'm not the center of it this time. So, James's play...
\Ah, yes. I figured you'd all be waiting to hear... but I think I should talk to James first.
"Of course! I'll help you find him.
aYou spot him in the corner of the room, talking to Tripp and Edgar. You lead Yasmin over to them.
Edgar
iAll <i>I'm</i> saying is The Crown and the Flame is not <i>just</i> a game, and it deserves some respect!
GSorry to interrupt. I've got someone here who wants to talk to James...
!Of course! We'll get out of here.
*James, we'll finish this discussion later.
I guess that's my cue, too.
d{You}, you put in so much work getting my play to the stage. I think you deserve to hear this too...
James lets out a shaky sigh.

MUSIC_COLLEGE_TENSE_ACTION
I should...
Hold James's hand.
Do nothing.
Relationship Improved
.Your relationship with James will be affected.
VYou reach out, take James's hand in yours, and give it a squeeze. James smiles at you.
(Okay, I'm ready. Give it to me straight.
Okay, I'm ready. Let's hear it.
àThe performance went off without a hitch, and your audience loved it. In my opinion, I'd say that it's definitely marketable material...
\I think you may have a hit on your hands, and I'd be a fool to miss out on this opportunity.
%Yasmin extends her hand toward James.
(I'd like to do business with you, James.
=James stands still for a moment... then shakes Yasmin's hand.
I-I can't believe it...
<jiggle>Yeah!</jiggle>
dYou let out a cheer, and everyone who was pretending not to listen comes over to congratulate James.
I knew you had it in you!
Congratulations, man!
I think this calls for drinks!
iZack turns the music up to full volume, and Darren starts pouring a line of drinks on the kitchen island.
1Here's my card, James. We can talk details later.
AThank you, Yasmin. Thank you so much. I can't even-- I mean, wow.
~Don't thank me until <i>after</i> you've gone through the revision process. Trust me, it's a doozy. For now, enjoy your night!
.Yasmin shoos you and James off to the kitchen.
~All of the play's cast, along with Professor Vasquez and Yasmin, gather around the island, drinks in hand. James picks one up.
Brandon
Speech!
Oh, I couldn't...
-Everyone quiet! James is gonna say something.
YThe excited buzz in the room dies down, and all eyes turn to James. He clears his throat.
≤Heh, for a playwright, I'm really not great at speeches. So, I'll keep it short. None of this would have happened without every one of you, and I can't thank you enough for that.
†But there's two people I have to thank in particular. Professor Vasquez, for mentoring me, pushing me, and giving me the opportunity to make my dream reality...
bAnd {You}, for helping me put all of this together and for her unwavering support. So... drink up?
%Everyone starts to lift their cups...
&Wait! We've got to toast to something.
Let's toast to...
James!
Yasmin!
Me!
ATo James, the best writer we know. No offense, Professor Vasquez.
+Just this once, {You}, I won't correct you.
	To James!
	To James!
Everyone
;To Yasmin, the only agent crazy enough to take this guy on!
2Hey! Don't say anything that will change her mind.

To Yasmin!

To Yasmin!
Everyone
RYasmin bows her head modestly, smiling as she lifts her drink before taking a sip.
That's very kind of you.
VTo me! Because we all know that without me this show would have gone straight to hell!
'Well... she <i>kind of</i> has a point.
	To {You}!
	To {You}!
Everyone
(Everyone sips from their cups in unison.
1Logan deftly bounces a ping pong ball into a cup.
UIt's really a lot easier than everyone says it is. Just drink, stack, bounce, repeat.
PI see... but doesn't stacking the cup make it more difficult to bounce the ball?
+Well, yeah! That's what makes the game fun!
0But, what happens once all the cups are stacked?
dThen someone's stuck drinking the full cup in the middle, and then we reset the cups and play again.
+Vasquez scribbles furiously on his notepad.
#Using the same cups? Interesting...
ÖI'm telling you, I didn't even think. I just put my arms around him, and squeezed and squeezed until the lobster puff flew right out.
,And <i>that's</i> how you met Stephen King?!
0I had no idea who he was until he turned around.
HWow. 'Thanks for saving my life' makes one hell of a book inscription...
0Is this the 'twerking' I've heard so much about?
Nooo, twerking looks like this!
oMadison starts twerking. Vasquez stares at her wide-eyed for a moment, then begins to scribble in his notebook.
)I see, I see. This is excellent material.
%Professor, are you drawing a diagram?
MIt's all part of the process, {You}. You don't sell books with fuzzy details.
2Aw, come on Professor, have one more shot with us?
}You can stay longer if you want. I'll admit, this is the first time I haven't wanted to tear my hair out at the sight of you.
Yasmin helps Vasquez to the door. He's a bit more disheveled than you've ever seen him, but he looks happier than you've ever seen him, too.
áOh, I'm way too old to be staying up all night. So, {You}, if you could just write up, oh, ten pages or so on the rest of the evening--
Vasquez!
pCome on, I'm <i>joking.</i> I'm allowed a sense of humor after a few shots and some jungle juice, I would think.
NAt the doorway, Vasquez turns and places his hand heavily on James's shoulder.
tAnd you, young man, should be extremely proud of yourself. 'You will obtain your goal, if you maintain your course.'
yThank you, sir. That means a lot coming from you... although I admit I don't recognize the quote. Marcus Aurelius, maybe?
bA fortune cookie that came with last night's dinner, but appropriate for the occasion nonetheless.
jAgain, {You}, thanks for having us. I'll make sure he gets home okay. James, give me a call whenever you--
MUSIC_COLLEGE_TENSE_SAD
_Vasquez suddenly stumbles, gripping the doorframe for support. His eyes look oddly unfocused...
Professor Vasquez, are you--
aVasquez collapses to the ground. Yasmin immediately drops to her knees and rolls him on his back.
&Maybe he's just had too much to drink?
@You immediately think of the cancer he's been struggling with...
:Or something much worse. Someone call an ambulance... now!
BWill Professor Vasquez be okay? Play the next chapter to find out!
VYou smile and lean against the door. Chris grins at you, pulling your hips toward him.
+I don't think anyone saw us. You can relax.
Make me.
lChris hoists you up, and you wrap your legs around his waist again, your back pressed hard against the door.
Chris... take off my clothes.
 You don't have to tell me twice.

Chris carries you to the bed.
8I can't wait to get you out of that <i>sexy</i> t-shirt.
7Hey! You know what's less sexy? Being covered in salsa.
5Oh, I don't know... That salsa was pretty <i>hot.</i>
SYou groan at Chris's awful joke as he laughs and slips your t-shirt over your head.
MChris carries you to the bed, undoing the zipper of your dress with one hand.
"Mmm... That's an impressive skill.
I'm a great multitasker.
ZHe slips the straps of your dress down your shoulders. His fingers trace across your skin.

§He pushes you back onto the bed, kissing down your chest as he tugs your clothes farther down. You grab the sheets as he leaves a kiss just below your belly button.
Chris...
∏He pulls your clothes down past your knees, grabbing the edge of your panties with his teeth and pulling them along, too. Then, he pulls his shirt up over his head and tosses it aside.

(Now I've got you right where I want you.

Chris, I want...
You. Right now!
You to just kiss me.
XSeriously, it's cold in here, and I want this bed to be about a thousand degrees warmer.
IYou grab Chris's arm and pull him on top of you. He kisses you fervently.
Warmer?
Chris
We're getting there...
mYou roll over on top of him, running gentle scratches down his chest as you reach for the band of his boxers.
{You}, I...
Chris
Shh. Time for talking is over.
ÖChris puts a hand on the back of your neck, drawing you back down to him for another heated kiss. He rolls again to be on top, and...
<i>Oof!</i>
'You both end up in a heap on the floor.
AFor a second you're both quiet, and then you can't stop laughing.
Are you okay?
Chris
I'm all good. So, can we...
Keep going?
Get back in bed?
Right here?
Chris
EChris, I literally wouldn't care if an earthquake happened right now.
Fair enough.
Chris
ÅYou pull the blanket off of your bed and wrap it around the two of you on the floor. Chris brings his mouth down to meet yours...
ELater, you and Chris lay in a tangle of sheets on the floor, panting.

.Your relationship with Chris will be affected.
SWell, that was... new. But I kinda liked it. Plus, you can't roll off of the floor.
eChris laughs, wrapping an arm around your shoulders, cradling your head against the side of his neck.
=Bed, floor, whatever. I don't care, as long as it's with you.
Chris
EI could stay here all night, but we really should get back out there.
5Yeah, I guess you're right. The party's not over yet.
Chris
MYou smile at him, and give him a kiss before you get up to find your clothes.
>The floor's a little rough. I don't mean to ruin the moment...
6I'd say the moment's already been a little bit ruined.
Chris
nYou laugh as Chris helps you to your feet. You crawl back into bed and wrap the blanket around the two of you.
Comfy?
Chris
Almost!
XYou pull him back on top of you, caressing his jaw as you bring him in for another kiss.
Now, where were we...
YA short while later, you lay across Chris's chest, your body rising and falling with his.

J<i>Wow,</i> {You}. That was amazing. Especially that thing you did where--
Chris
-No, no, no. We shall never speak of it again.
!Okay... but will you do it again?
Chris
?You smile up at Chris while he plays with a piece of your hair.
5We should really get back out there. Maybe next time?
"Okay... but what if I said please?
Chris
UHe grins at you, and you give him a playful shove as you get up to find your clothes.
NIt's so cold... I want you to warm me up a little bit. But just kissing, okay?
"You know I'd never say no to that.
Chris
|Chris crawls into bed with you, scooping you up into his arms. He cradles you against him and wraps you both in the blanket.
Better?

Mmm... much.

!{You}? I'm really glad we talked.

@Yeah, me too. It was nice to get everything all out in the open.
SChris plants a few quick kisses the back of your neck at the base of your hairline.
!We should probably get back soon.
Chris
I know... just, not yet.
yChris squeezes you tight around the middle. You can feel his heart beating at your back. Slowly, you begin to doze off...
XAfter a while, you are woken up by a thumping bass beat, and someone gently shaking you.
{You}! Hey, you fell asleep...
Voice
&<i>Mom,</i> five more minutes, please?
.When you hear Chris's laugh, you bolt upright.
/Oh my god. How long were you trying to wake me?
ÉNot too long. But, hey, am I glad to not be your mom. It must have been a pain in the ass getting you up for school in the morning.
Chris
(You glance at the clock by your bedside.
#Crap, we should get back out there.
Do we have to?
Chris
MWell, we're <i>technically</i> hosting. So, yeah. Come on, let's get dressed.

OKaitlyn keeps kissing down your neck until her mouth reaches your collarbone...
dYou shudder as her lips move over your bare skin, one of her hands moving down to stroke your thigh.
LI like watching you when I kiss you like that... your reactions are so cute.
(Stop, you're making me self-conscious...
	Don't be.
lKaitlyn tilts your chin to her lips and kisses you deeply, then sits back on her heels, smiling down at you.
ZShe shrugs out of her layers and pulls her shirt up over her head, shaking her hair loose.
Wow...
KaitlynUnderwear
What?
Kaitlyn
;I'm not sure I'll <i>ever</i> get used to how sexy you are.
,Especially when you're in my bed... naked...
Speaking of which...
Kaitlyn
]Kaitlyn wriggles out of her jeans and tosses them on your floor, then lies down behind you...
WAs much as I like your emergency backup t-shirt... I think it's about time it came off.
Kaitlyn
<I might just leave it on if you don't stop making fun of me.
1Ah, don't do that! I take back everything I said.
Kaitlyn
Good.
bYou help Kaitlyn pull your t-shirt up over your head, then pull your jeans down and kick them off.
#Wow, <i>someone's</i> in a hurry...
Kaitlyn
/I don't want to waste a single second with you.
Smooth.
Kaitlyn
óYou're about to reply when Kaitlyn's hand slides down the front of your underwear, her other hand curving up around your side to slip under your bra...
You feel her tugging the zipper of your dress down, hooking her fingers under the straps and sliding them off your shoulders...
KAs much as I like this dress on you... I think it's about time it came off.
Kaitlyn
Mmm...
I agree.
#I think it'd be hot to leave it on.
vYou help Kaitlyn pull your dress up over your head and feel her skin against yours as she holds you tight from behind.
EShe tucks her chin over your shoulder and kisses your cheek softly...
Now there's nothing between us.
Kaitlyn
2Not quite... you haven't taken off my underwear...
%Maybe I'll just work around it, then.
Kaitlyn
ÖYou shiver as Kaitlyn toys with the waistband of your underwear, her other hand curving up around your side to slip under your bra...
&You know what? I think you're right...

7Just... be careful. This <i>is</i> a pretty nice dress.

pYou twist around to kiss Kaitlyn while her hand slips over your side to gather your skirt up around your hips...
`You blush and bite back a moan as you feel her fingers between your legs, making Kaitlyn giggle.
)I take it you like me touching you there?
Kaitlyn
Y-yes...
Then that's what I want to do.
Kaitlyn
lLater, you lie with your head nestled against Kaitlyn's chest, her hands lazily running through your hair...
/Mmm... that was amazing. <i>You're</i> amazing.

I just know what you like.

$I mean, it's usually pretty obvious.

I feel the same way.
ONow... what do you say we get back to the party? People might start missing us.
/Right about now, I'm having a hard time caring.
Kaitlyn
wBut I guess we should get back out there. This <i>is</i> a cast party, and we're a pretty important part of the cast...
Kaitlyn
My thoughts exactly.
:You didn't happen to see where my underwear went, did you?
BI kind of just threw them in the general direction of your closet.

QYou wish. Come and help me look, lazy. Then we're going back to <i>our</i> party.

-Once inside, James locks the door behind him.
-I can't wait to get you out of those clothes.
>Oh yeah? Is this where you show me some of those new 'tricks'?
eJames cups your face between his palms. He kisses you hard and deep. He leans in to whisper to you...
If you want me to.
VJames grins and pulls you in for another kiss, leading you toward the edge of the bed.
XSuddenly, James spins you around, nudging you forward so that you're bent over your bed.
Oh! James, what--
bJames sweeps your hair over one shoulder, covering the back of your neck with featherlight kisses.
James...
YHe slowly pushes your t-shirt up your back. His kisses follow its trail along your spine.
/Eventually, he pulls your shirt over your head.
`He slowly unzips the back of your dress. His kisses follow the trail all the way down your back.
/That kind of tickles... but it's a good tickle.
Good, because I'm not done yet.
ïYou feel the solid warmth of his body pressed against yours. He reaches around your body, his hands traveling upward from your thighs to your throat.
"Th-this is taking too <i>long!</i>
ÖJames chuckles, pulling you back upright against him. His fingers graze your shoulders as he glides your clothes down past your hips.
 Have a little patience, {You}...

I guess...
I can wait a little longer.
I'm just impatient then.
tJames nibbles on your shoulders. One hand drags up your inner thigh, while the other travels your stomach and chest.
7James... I-I don't know if I can take this much longer.
&Okay, okay. But what's the magic word?
Clothes. Off. Now.
=And here I was thinking I might get to be in charge for once.
XYou turn to face him. You pull him into a passionate kiss as you start to undress him...
1You should know by now that I'm always in charge.
?James undoes the buckle of his belt and steps out of his pants.
äAnd, as you might remember, there's currently a party going on in <i>your</i> honor. So, I'm feeling like we're on a bit of a time crunch.
WHe pushes your clothes down the rest of the way, until they lie in a heap on the floor.
9So, I suppose we're going the quick and dirty route then.
TYou turn to face him, running your hands up his chest as you start to undress him...
I like the sound of that.
hHe pushes you back on the bed with a grin, and undoes the buckle of his belt. He steps out of his pants.
æJames gets under the covers of your bed and pulls you toward him. Your back is to him, and you nestle comfortably into the contour of his body. He covers your neck and shoulders with kisses.
James...
I can't wait any longer.
Can we stay just like this?
JamesShirtless
Oh, thank god. Neither can I.
James
WHe runs his hand down your chest, then your stomach, stopping only to grasp your thigh.
Oh...
{You}...
James
I'm just so warm, and comfy...
SOf course, {You}. If it were up to me, I'd hold on to you forever and never let go.
James
TThen how would you ever get any work done on your soon-to-be blockbuster screenplay?
OI guess I'll abandon my dreams of being a playwright to live here in your dorm.
James
=You smile to yourself, kissing the arm he's slung across you.
4My own personal bedwarmer? I like the sound of that.
/James laughs, and kisses the back of your neck.
I'm so happy I met you, {You}.
James
Yeah, me too.
wAfter a few minutes of silence, you hear James snoring softly as he starts to fall asleep. Slowly, you drift off too...
;You're woken suddenly by a loud crash from the living room.
iYou realize you must have fallen asleep. You turn around and see that James is still sleeping peacefully.
9(I know I should wake him up, but he just looks so cute.)
I should...
Kiss him awake.
Shake him awake.
Yell in his ear.
dYou lean over and kiss James softly on the lips. When you lean back, his eyes are beginning to open.
QYou grab his shoulder and start to shake. After a second, his eyes begin to open.
@You lean over quietly, positioning your lips just above his ear.
<shake_portrait/>JAMES!
"You giggle as James bolts upright.
.{You}... ? What-- Oh crap, did we fall asleep?
James
OYeah, but not for very long. It sounds like the party's still raging out there.
vJames leans heavily against the pillows. He reaches up and runs his finger across your bottom lip, smiling to himself.
5I guess we should go back. Just... five more minutes.

ESomeone bangs heavily on your door. James sighs and rolls off of you.
hI can hear you in there! I've been waiting out here for, like, forever, and I <i>really</i> have to pee!

9You and James look at each other and burst into laughter.
0I guess that's a no to those extra five minutes.
