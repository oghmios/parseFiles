Chapter Eight: The Hospital
The Freshman
You
BG_INT_HOSPITAL_WAITING_NIGHT
kYou sit in the hospital's waiting room with James and Yasmin, the overhead fluorescents buzzing like flies.
James
3I can't believe it. He seemed fine earlier tonight.
SAD
@It's probably nothing, right? Just low blood sugar or something.
It could be. Or...
`Yasmin finishes speaking to the doctor nearby. She walks up to you and gives you a warning look.
Yasmin
\I'm sure the professor wouldn't want us discussing his <i>sensitive medical information.</i>
ANGRY
O-of course.
	SURPRISED
kJames, it sounds like they'll be keeping him for evaluation for a few days, but you can go talk to him now.
I'd like that.
FWithout another word, James walks down the hall toward Vasquez's room.
1Vasquez told me you're aware of his... condition.
Yes. And apparently so are you.
9It's my job to know these things. It affects my business.
[It's also my job to keep my clients happy, and that means keeping Vasquez's cancer private.
Sounds like...
NEUTRAL
This is all about money to you.
You have a sense of loyalty.
$That just shows how little you know.
TIf I were trying to make a buck, I'd leak the news of Vasquez's cancer to the media.
<Book sales would be up thirty percent by breakfast tomorrow.
So why don't you?
ABecause I play the long game. My clients know my word is my bond.
"If I lose that, I lose everything.
,I'm a businesswoman, but my word is my bond.
7I'll protect Vasquez's secret. And I hope you will too.
1But what about James? Doesn't he deserve to know?
$He deserves to hear it from Vasquez.
)Just then, James walks out, smiling wide.
NBased on the way he was berating the nurse, I'd say he's feeling a lot better.
HAPPY
iHe says the doctor gave him a clean bill of health. They're just keeping him here as an extra precaution.
Oh... great...
/He told me not to wait up. Should we head home?
Sounds like a good idea.
lYasmin shoots you one last stern glare before turning and leaving, her heels clicking on the hospital floor.
BG_EXT_CAMPUS_QUAD_WINTER_NIGHT
MUSIC_COLLEGE_LOVE_SAD
4A little later, you and James arrive back on campus.
YSo... what now? I'm sure the party is over if you want to head back to my place and talk.
ÖI'm going to stop by Vasquez's office and pick up his laptop. If he goes more than a few hours without writing he gets pretty cranky.
JWait. You mean this whole time I've been seeing him in a <i>good</i> mood?
Heh. Exactly.
...
James? Are you okay?
%I'm sure it's nothing... it's just...
XDespite everything Vasquez told me, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.
Am I missing something here?
BFor a moment, the world seems to stop, and you take a deep breath.
I...
/You can tell me anything. You know that, right?
GYou take another breath and remember what Professor Vasquez told you...
BG_INT_OFFICE_PROFESSOR
9Oh my god... how long have you known? Does Gabriela know?
Vasquez
No, of course not.
Does <i>James</i>?
No... and you won't tell him.
James, I...
The truth is...
Professor Vasquez has cancer.
I don't know.
Are... are you sure?
Truth Teller
#You told Vasquez's secret to James.
Yes.
How long have you known?
Since last quarter.
+So you've been lying to me this whole time?
BHe's interrupted as you see a figure emerge from Vasquez's office.
Gabriela
...
KCrying, Gabriela falls to her knees in the snow, dropping a stack of books.
Gabriela! Are you okay?
0Far from it. I just got the news about my dad...
7He told me to come here and pick up some books, and I--
^James helps her up. She groans under the weight of her pregnant belly as she gets to her feet.
;Come on. Let's get you to the hospital. You should see him.
I... I can get there on my own.
'She looks at you with fury in her eyes.
3My father told me <i>everything</i> over the phone.
@You could have told me, you know. Back when you first found out.
I guess we're both in the dark.
Secret Keeper

You kept Vasquez's secret.
Yeah...

MUSIC_COLLEGE_TENSE_ACTION
=You're interrupted by the sound of soft clapping from nearby.
HBravo. My father mentioned that you'd taken up acting in his last email.
$But I had no idea how good you were.
"Gabriela? What are you doing here?
1My father has me listed as his emergency contact.
WI was on the way to the hospital when he called and asked me to bring him a few things.
.Normally, I would have told him to go to hell.
9But even I can't turn my back on him at a time like this.
I'm confused. What's going on?
nGo on, {You}. Tell him the truth. Just like you should have told <i>me</i> the truth when you first found out!
ZI... he must have wanted to make sure he didn't upset you... with the baby coming and all.
GToo late for that. The cat's out of the bag. My dad told me everything.
1Now are you going to tell James, or do I have to?
James, Professor Vasquez...
He has cancer.
How bad is it?
	Terminal.
Relationship Damaged
.Your relationship with James will be affected.
+So you've been lying to me this whole time?
@I'll leave you two to sort this out. I'm going to see my father.
BWithout another word, Gabriela trudges off toward the parking lot.
IJames watches, looking shell-shocked as she disappears into the distance.
Cancer? I can't believe it...
James...
Looking back...
I should have told you sooner.
 I should have let Gabriela know.
I did the right thing.
You're right. You should have.
But I can't change the past.
I know.
So where does that leave us?
-Vasquez asked me to keep a secret. And I did.
,Even though it meant lying to me for months.
I didn't say it was easy.
...
Please say something.
What is there to say?
sYou and Vasquez are the two most important people in my life at Hartfeld... and you've been lying to me for months.
relationships
-I... I thought maybe I even <i>loved</i> you.
%But I guess I didn't know you at all.
James, wait, I--
=I'm sorry, {You}. I just need to be alone for a little while.
But... what about us?
I think we should take a break.
^He turns and walks slowly into Vasquez's office, leaving you alone in the softly falling snow.
Relationship Severed
You and James are on a break.
James...
-I thought you were one of my closest friends.
I am!
I wish I could believe you.
James...
?Maybe it's better if we just don't hang out for a little bit...
^He turns and walks slowly into Vasquez's office, leaving you alone in the softly falling snow.
BG_INT_DORM_MAIN_NIGHT
MUSIC_COLLEGE_FUN_CHILL
PYou arrive back at your dorm to find your roommates cleaning up after the party.
Chris
There you are!
Abbie
We were worried. Is Vasquez--
He's okay. For now.
Zack
Oh, {You}, come here.
 Zack pulls you in for a big hug.
Kaitlyn
FOkay, you're clearly in need of some serious suitemate TLC. Ice cream?
QYou curl up on the couch. Over the next hour, you tell your friends everything...
NHe told me to keep it a secret. He even threatened to revoke my scholarship...
#I wish I could say I'm surprised...
.Gabriela looked so hurt. And I would be too...
CImagine if some random girl kept <i>your</i> dad's cancer a secret.
"But it wasn't your secret to tell.

Wasn't it?
+And now James says that we're 'on a break.'
0I didn't even know you were officially together.
,Yeah, well, it lasted for about three hours.
)That's pretty short even by my standards.
*And James basically dumped me as a friend.
CDon't worry. I'm sure he's just hurt. He'll forgive you eventually.
Tyler
kI wouldn't be so sure. A cerebral guy like that? He could hold onto that kind of betrayal for <i>years.</i>
,Tyler! We're supposed to be cheering her up!
Oops. My bad!
JCan we talk about something else? Like, Kaitlyn, what happened with Arjun?
_Huh? Nothing happened. We hung out for a bit, shared some memories, and he eventually took off.
So you didn't tell him--
Uh... it didn't come up!
BAnd what about you, Chris? How's the presidential campaign coming?
0Heh. I guess I'd better start figuring that out.
AI can't wait to see the look on Sebastian's face when I beat him.
QSoon, you're lost in conversation and almost able to forget your talk with James.
)I actually had a great time at the party.
ZI spent like an hour listening to Edgar and Leila argue about the definition of 'organic.'
TIt was like watching a train wreck in slow motion. They almost had a physical fight!
AAnd I totally saw Logan and Tripp thumb wrestling up on the roof!
6As the night winds down, your friends all head to bed.
GJust remember, we've got your back. Always. Even if other people don't.
Thanks.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_LOVE
DAs everyone else goes to sleep, Chris sits on the couch next to you.
Feeling better?
	A little.
Chris takes your hand.
JI'm sorry about James... the way he turned his back on you. What an idiot.
PI made the mistake of losing you once. I'm never going to let that happen again.
He pulls you close.

I think...
I should go to bed.
We should go to bed.

Of course.
5He gives you one final squeeze before he lets you go.
DGoodnight, {You}. I'm sure this will all look better in the morning.
7You take Chris's hand and lead him toward your bedroom.

Are you sure you want to--
Yes. Believe me. I need this.
Whatever helps...
BG_INT_DORM_BEDROOM_NIGHT
XSoon, all of your cares melt away, if only for a moment, as Chris holds you in his arms.
6Tell me we can just stay here forever and never leave.
Relationship Improved
.You and Chris's relationship will be affected.
chris
5Of course, we'll eventually have to go get breakfast.
I do love breakfast...
bActually... if I want a shot at being president, I'll probably have to start planning my campaign.
Heh. I'm so excited for you.
\You can work on becoming president. Breakfast with the roomies sounds <i>almost</i> as good.
FAs everyone else goes to sleep, Kaitlyn sits on the couch next to you.
,It's going to be okay. You know that, right?
Do I?
4She wraps her arms around you, pulling you in tight.
&What can I do to make you feel better?

I think...
I just need to be alone.
We should head back to my room.
I totally get it.
%She leans in closer for one last hug.
3Goodnight, {You}. I'm sure everything will be okay.
+I was hoping you'd say something like that.
eA few minutes later, you're holding Kaitlyn close, and all thoughts of James and Vasquez melt away...
FIt's nice to forget your worries, even if it's only for a few minutes.
 What are girlfriends for, right?
*'Girlfriend.' I like hearing you say that.
Relationship Improved
0You and Kaitlyn's relationship will be affected.
kaitlyn
Me too.
AAfter everyone has gone to bed, you look around the empty room...
Looks like I'm alone.
1You head back to your room and collapse into bed.
DIt's been a hell of a night, but the sun's still coming up tomorrow.
EFor a while you toss and turn, before settling into a fitful sleep...
BG_INT_DORM_BEDROOM_DAY
The next morning...
BG_INT_COFFEE_SHOP_WINTER_DAY
MUSIC_COLLEGE_WINTER
0You head to the coffee shop with Zack and Tyler.
<No matter how sad you're feeling, a warm drink always helps.
Yeah...
Any word from James?
7You check your phone and open your text log with James.
FOh, hell no! Do <i>not</i> tell me you're going to text him right now.
'Trust me, a guy like James needs space.
'I dunno. It couldn't hurt to reach out.
I'm going to...
	Text him!
Give him some space.
You quickly text James.
&<i>Really sorry... you doing okay?</i>
Text

You wait for a response...
And wait...
And wait even longer...
He's not texting back.
GI... I think I feel even worse now. I didn't realize that was possible.
Sorry, {You}.
=Zack is right. James asked for space. I have to respect that.
oGood call. Don't worry... I'm sure you'll hear from him soon enough, once he's had a chance to lick his wounds.
5Just then, Brandon walks up to Zack, holding a drink.
Brandon
EHere's a latte for my little coffee bean... and some cocoa for {You}.
CGuess I'd better enjoy the perks of dating a barista while I can...
ZAw. Don't be like that. I'm only going to be off in Peru for a few months. You'll survive.
_And anyway... it's our <i>monthaversary</i> tomorrow! You should be planning something special!
Who says I'm not?
DI get off at six tomorrow night. You'd better be here to pick me up.
"We'll see. Maybe you'll get lucky.
I like the sound of that.
;Brandon heads back to the counter as you shoot Zack a look.
Hey...
You two are so cute!
Is everything okay?

Obviously.
pIt seems like you're totally taking the whole 'my boyfriend is moving to Peru for three months' thing in stride!
Yeah. Totally.
I don't know...
=The truth is, I've never done the long-distance thing before!
(I don't even know if I <i>can</i> do it.
;Aw! I'm sure you guys'll be okay. You're an awesome couple!
	Thanks...
YWell, anyway, I should probably figure out what we're doing for our monthaversary, right?
YI thought you guys were joking about that. Monthaversaries aren't a real thing, are they?
)Uh, they totally <i>are</i> a real thing.
RWait a second... what day of the month did you and Abbie finally make it official?
No comment.
It's today, isn't it?
Theoretically... yes.
HBut there's no rule saying I <i>have</i> to do something special, right?
=Sure, just like Abbie doesn't <i>have</i> to keep dating you.
4Is it getting stuffy in here? My palms are sweating.
#I'm panicking, {You}! What do I do?
Tyler...
%I'll help you plan something awesome!
anniversary
You're on your own.
'Don't worry, buddy. I've got your back.
%Now, here's what we're going to do...
CSorry, buddy. I've got problems of my own to worry about right now.
-Understood. I'll figure out something myself.

Just then, Abbie walks in.
Hey, guys. What's up?
Nothing! I was just leaving!
	Oh, okay.
HAfter giving Abbie an awkward hug, Tyler quickly leaves the coffee shop.
Is everything okay with him?
He's just being... himself.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_COMEDY_MISCHIEF
Later that evening...
]Quick! Get up on the roof! We only have a few more minutes to get everything ready for Abbie!
$I'll stay down here to wait for her.
Right, on it!
 BG_EXT_DORM_ROOFTOP_WINTER_NIGHT
@You scurry up to the rooftop where Kaitlyn and Zack are arguing.
WRed roses are the <i>definition</i> of cliche. What's next? Champagne and strawberries?
QThey're cliche for a <i>reason!</i> Nobody looks at orchids and thinks 'romance.'
NYou turn to Chris, who is quietly organizing a plate of cookies in the corner.
8They've been arguing over this for the last ten minutes.
[{You}, tell Kaitlyn that orchids are ugly and that we should use roses for the centerpiece.
L{You}, tell Zack that orchids aren't ugly, and that roses are a lame cliche.
#You look at Chris again. He shrugs.
Okay, well...
You should use...
Roses.
Orchids.
=I'm with Zack on this one. You can't go wrong with a classic.
1Zack puts his bouquet into the vase triumphantly.
Told you! Majority rules.
Humph.
=You're just mad because your girlfriend didn't side with you.
No I'm not!
Yes you are!
No I'm not!
Yes you are!
No I'm-
"You cut her off with a quick kiss.

Okay, okay. I forgive you.
#How could you do this to me, {You}?
>After all the times we've shared, you sided with Zack over me?

I thought we were friends!
_Remember that time you told me who died in the season finale of <i>The Crown and the Flame</i>?
<jiggle>YOU DID WHAT?</jiggle>
I... I made a mistake.
Yeah. I owe you nothing.
 Well played, {You}. Well played.
<jiggle>I told you so!</jiggle>
6You're just saying that because she's your girlfriend!
WMaybe I did. Or maybe she's my girlfriend <i>because</i> she has good taste in flowers.
Awww. Come here you.
)Kaitlyn kisses you playfully on the lips.
Get a room.
Maybe later...
6You're only siding with her because she's your bestie!
SPlus, don't think I didn't see those sparks when you two were in the play together!
dOkay Zack, we all know you're jealous that I got to kiss {You} on stage, but it's time to let it go.
Ew, I don't even...
"Okay, orchids are fine. Just fine.
-You artfully arrange the orchids in the vase.
Perfect.
Tyler pokes his head in.
AGuys, Abbie just texted me. She's gonna be back in just a minute!
Everyone hide!
#You and Zack hide behind the couch.
I hear footsteps!
<Just then, you hear the sound of the door to the suite open.
What do I do?
Yell 'SURPRISE!'
Wait.

<jiggle>SURPRISE!</jiggle>
 She's still downstairs, {You}...
*A few seconds later, the door swings open.

<jiggle>SURPRISE!</jiggle>
,Heh. Kind of. I heard {You} from downstairs.
#Everybody else stands up awkwardly.
Heh. Sorry guys.
LDon't apologize. It was hilarious. And I <i>was</i> surprised... downstairs!
=You can hear Abbie and Tyler's muffled voices from the suite.
"Come on, come on, get her up here!
$Finally, the door to the roof opens.
What do I do?
	Hesitate.
Shout 'SURPRISE!'
Stay hidden.

<jiggle>SURPRISE!</jiggle>

<jiggle>SURPRISE!</jiggle>

<jiggle>SURPRISE!</jiggle>

<jiggle>SURPRISE!</jiggle>
Oh my gosh, you guys.

<jiggle>SURPRISE!</jiggle>

<jiggle>SURPRISE!</jiggle>

<jiggle>SURPRISE!</jiggle>
Oh my gosh, you guys.
But where's {You}?
Wait, wasn't she right here?
You stand up sheepishly.
1Sorry, I guess I'm not good at surprising people.
So what's the occasion?
It's our monthaversary!
	Our what?
"We got together a month ago today!
*Oh, Tyler, you didn't have to do anything.
Tyler shoots Zack a look.
But I'm so glad you did!
...
DTyler leads Abbie over to the table and pulls out the chair for her.
After you, my dear.
...
>Welcome to the Cafe de Hartfeld, here is the menu for tonight.
?You hand Abbie a handmade menu detailing a three course dinner.
'Oh! Did you really get all this for me?

Well, I had a little help.
She leans in to kiss him.
Relationship Improved
0Abbie and Tyler's relationship will be affected.
tyler_abbie
3You just earned some major boyfriend points. Major.
GUp first is a vegetable risotto with a side of sauteed brussel sprouts.
Did you guys cook this?
Definitely.
sIf it tastes exactly like the food from the French restaurant down the street that's a <i>complete</i> coincidence.
0For the next course, champagne and strawberries!

Seriously?
These are amazing!
-Well, I guess I could be wrong about cliches.
AFinally, the meal is over. Abbie blots at her eyes with a napkin.

Abbie? Is everything okay?
LIt's just... this is like the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for me.
_She gets up, and walks toward Tyler. She gives him a massive hug. Soon, they're kissing deeply.
@I think we might want to get out of here before this gets PG-13.
rYou and your friends head downstairs, leaving Tyler and Abbie to enjoy the rest of their monthaversary in private.
NA few days later, you and your suitemates are all hanging out at your place...
OStill no word from James, huh? Sounds like it's a good night for a distraction!
1Like watching TV until my eyes bleed? Sign me up.
cOh nice! I can't believe I spaced on this... it's Warriors vs. Cavs tonight! This is gonna be good.
Sounds perfect to me!
sWe are <i>not</i> missing the season premiere of 'The Crown and the Flame' because of some stupid sportsball match!
I'm with Abbie.
ESmart man. Looks like it's two against two. What do you think, {You}?
FWait, shouldn't Kaitlyn weigh in on this? She has lots of... opinions.
:I think she's upstairs, taking a phone call... from Arjun.
HWait, what? Does that mean she <i>still</i> hasn't told him that she's--
Just then, Kaitlyn walks in.
.Uh, guys. I just got off the phone with Arjun.
/And... I kind of told him we could... hang out.
You mean like... a date?
(What? No! He distinctly said 'hang out'!
Yeah, that's a date.
dThis could get awkward! Find out what happens when Kaitlyn and Arjun 'hang out' in the next chapter!
