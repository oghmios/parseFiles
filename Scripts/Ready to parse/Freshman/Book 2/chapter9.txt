MUSIC_COLLEGE_COMEDY_MISCHIEF
MYou and your suitemates gather around the table, staring at Kaitlyn in shock.
TKaitlyn, if you knew he might be into you, why would you agree to hang out with him?
	SURPRISED
Kaitlyn
?I don't know. I thought he meant hang out, not <i>hang out!</i>
Crap, what am I going to do?!
SAD
Zack
GI think the easiest thing at this point would be to just marry the guy.
Chris
Zack!
Abbie
Seriously not helping.
ANGRY
&Guys, back to me. <i>What do I do?</i>
It's simple. Just tell Arjun...
NEUTRAL
You have to study.
You're into me.
You have the stomach flu.
PThat could work. You just found out you've got a pop quiz, and you can't go out.

I guess I could do that...
!But I don't want to lie to Arjun!
4Honey, you've been lying to him since he got here...

Relationship Improved
0You and Kaitlyn's relationship will be affected.
Plain and simple.
We've talked about this before.
relationships
m{You}... I really, really want to. I want to tell my whole family about you, it's just... not the right time.
E{You}... You know I would if I could it's just... not the right time.
YYou know I can't do that. Besides, that crush is <i>so</i> last quarter! Mostly. Sort of.
6Besides, Arjun's so sweet, and I've known him forever!
RSeriously! A stomach flu is <i>messy</i>. No way he'll still want to take you out.
JOne, ew, {You}. Two, Arjun's really sweet, and I don't want to lie to him.
*I just... don't want to hurt his feelings.
VSorry, Kaitlyn, but unless you go with Zack's idea, there's really no way to avoid it.
#<i>Ugh!</i> I am so <i>screwed.</i>
Tyler
Well, hey, maybe not!

Maybe not?
^Arjun asked you to hang out, but he didn't specify where or with how many other <i>people.</i>
\That's a great idea! Me and Tyler were gonna go ice skating tomorrow, but we can put it off.
HAPPY
6Tyler, you genius! I could totally kiss you right now.
$But don't. Definitely don't do that.
MBrandon was going to come over, but I'll tell him to meet up with us instead.
	I'm free!
/Sounds like roommate bonding day to me. I'm in.
IAw, you guys are the best suitemates a girl could ask for. Get over here.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_ACTION_FUN
@Kaitlyn throws her arms out and scoops you all into a group hug.
ANow, let's talk evasion tactics for Operation Let's Lie to Arjun.
Can we call it something else?
bIsn't this more about you <i>coming out</i> to Arjun and not avoiding telling your family forever?
=Alright, alright, fine. What about... Operation Just Friends?
That has a nice ring to it.
Everybody nods in agreement.
=Okay, it's settled. Operation Just Friends commences at 7:00.
DPM? That's definitely a date. That should have been your first clue.
;Yeah, yeah, I get it. I'm oblivious to typical dating cues.
HIt doesn't matter. We've got a lot of planning to do. Let's get rolling!

MUSIC_COLLEGE_TENSE_SAD
SYou and your suitemates stand outside Schmidt's Bar and Grill in downtown Hartfeld.
&You guys, I don't think I can do this.
SSeriously, what if Arjun really <i>is</i> into me? How am I going to turn him down?
UYou pull Kaitlyn into a tight hug, smoothing her hair down as you gently comfort her.
TKaitlyn, everything's going to be fine. This is why we came up with this whole plan.
%You pull back and look into her eyes.
0And I'll be there for you every step of the way.
TKaitlyn, everything's going to be fine. This is why we came up with this whole plan.
1And we'll be there for you every step of the way.
,Kaitlyn takes a deep breath and then smiles.
BOkay, coming out to Arjun. It's just Arjun. I can totally do this.
VYou loop one of your arms through Kaitlyn's, then gesture for Abbie to take the other.
Let's do this thing.
BG_EXT_CAMPUS_BAR_DIVE_NEUTRAL
ØYou walk into the dimly lit dive bar and immediately spot Arjun. He smiles when he sees Kaitlyn, but a look of confusion crosses his face as he takes in the rest of the group.
,He does <i>not</i> look too happy to see us.
FYou walk up to the bar. Chris pats Arjun on the back and grins at him.
Hey, man, how's it going?
Arjun
Uh, it's good! Kaitlyn... ?
ÖHey, Arjun! So glad you called to hang out. I've been needing some friend time lately. I hope you don't mind that I invited the gang.
AN-no... not at all. Any friends of Kaitlyn's are friends of mine.
HYou all grab drinks and head off to one of the corner booths in the bar.
VArjun slides in on one side of Kaitlyn, and you slip into the booth on her other side.
(So, Kaitlyn, I've been meaning to ask...
Kaitlyn inhales sharply.
kWhat were your favorite classes you took last quarter? I've got a few elective spots I'm looking to fill...
&Kaitlyn breathes out a sigh of relief.
gYou know what class I <i>loved</i>? Queer Cinema. We had that together last quarter, didn't we Kaitlyn?
XHey, Zack! You still owe me a rematch from the last time we played pool. I'm cashing in.
LI'll come, too. I saw you play last time Tyler. You might need some back-up.
fAs Zack, Tyler and Abbie head over to the nearest pool table, an awkward silence looms over the booth.
My favorite course was...
Feminism throughout History.
Beginning Beekeeping.
Art for Art's Sake.
IJust <i>thinking</i> about that class makes me want to listen to Beyonce.
MAfter the first few stings, you really start to build up an immunity to them.
mFor my final project, I just dumped a can of Spaghetti-o's on myself and sang the Patty Duke version of Ohio.
I got an A+.
DMy favorite class was probably Art Appreciation. And, speaking of...
SChris nods over his shoulder at a pretty redhead girl who just walked into the bar.
Talk about a work of art.
Hey!
TChris grins and wraps his arm around your shoulders. He kisses the top of your head.
INot for me, of course. I'm 100% taken. But, Arjun's a nice, single guy...
cMan, if I wasn't so busy with this campaign and school, I'd be over there making my move right now.
0Guess it's up to you, Arjun. For the both of us.
:Arjun glances at the redheaded girl and smiles sheepishly.
UShe <i>is</i> pretty. But, she's not really my type. I like girls with darker hair...
kAlmost imperceptibly, Kaitlyn grimaces. You think back to the plan you all came up with the night before...
@You drain the rest of your drink and set the glass on the table.
6Hey, Kaitlyn, would you mind getting me another drink?
Of course! Chris, come with me?
Sure thing.
>Kaitlyn and Chris take their leave, and you turn toward Arjun.
uSo, Arjun, you've known Kaitlyn a <i>really</i> long time. Are you excited you guys are going to school together now?
ÜTotally! It's been forever since I've seen Kaitlyn, and there's definitely something... different about her from back when I knew her.
Different? Different how?
UHmm... I don't really know. She seems more sure of herself than when we were younger.
;There's something attractive about that kind of confidence.
You mean, attractive in like...
A totally platonic way?
A sexy way?
cLike, 'Oh, I'm so happy my friend from childhood has grown into a self-assured, independent woman'?
IUh, sure. But I'm also impressed by her beauty, charisma, intelligence...
3Those are impressive qualities for a <i>friend.</i>
WArjun looks over to the bar where Chris and Kaitlyn are ordering and smiles to himself.
Right. A friend. For now...
FLike, 'everytime I see her I wanna rip her clothes off with my teeth'?
4I don't know if I'd put it like <i>that</i> exactly.
WArjun looks over to the bar where Chris and Kaitlyn are ordering and smiles to himself.
QBut I am looking forward to getting to know better the woman that she's becoming.
Huh. I see...
Are you dating anyone, {You}?
DYou look over at Chris and Kaitlyn at the bar and smile to yourself.
)Actually, me and Chris just got together.
AI mean officially. We had... some stuff to work out last quarter.
OI kind of got a sense something was going on between you two at the cast party.
0You glance over at Chris and Kaitlyn at the bar.
There's... someone.
*Oh yeah? Well, I wanna hear all about him.
You chuckle to yourself.
3Unfortunately for you Arjun, I don't kiss and tell.
Actually...
<You think about the last time you talked to James and frown.
Actually, I'm not sure.
BI <i>was</i> seeing someone. But we hit a bit of a... rough patch.
%Arjun smiles across the table at you.
ZI'm sorry to hear that. But you're a great girl, {You}. I'm sure you two will work it out!
)I wouldn't exactly call it <i>dating.</i>
CI've met a few people I like, but so far I am single and loving it.
You go, {You}!
rJust then, Chris and Kaitlyn arrive back at the table. Kaitlyn sets a drink in front of you and gives you a smile.
!What were you guys talking about?
"Just a little relationship gossip.
gI was just telling {You} that something seems different about you since I've seen you here at Hartfeld.
Oh, really... ?
ÖThere's a pause while you and Chris wait to see what Kaitlyn will say next. She starts to speak, then stops herself. Then, she sighs.
jWell, you know, college and all that. I guess that's why they call these the formative years of our lives!
I guess that's true.
Yeah, I guess so...
Excuse me, guys.
bArjun gets up and heads to the bathroom. Immediately, Tyler, Zack and Abbie run back to the booth.
JIs my quarantine at the pool table over yet? I promise I'll be a good boy!
&Shh! {You}, Kaitlyn, what did we miss?
What you missed was...
&Arjun is totally in love with Kaitlyn!
Kaitlyn totally chickening out!
CSeriously, you should have heard him when you guys went to the bar.
WMy guess is, the next time you guys 'hang out' he'll probably profess his love for you.
"Ah! Why is this getting so messy?!
ITell me about it! Do you have any idea how awkward that conversation was?
lYou reach over and brush Kaitlyn's hair out of her face. She smiles at you but looks around the room warily.
AI just want us to be able to be together. No matter where we are.
I know, me too...
IShe had the perfect opportunity to tell him, and she didn't say anything.
(That's not true! It didn't even come up.
R'There's something different about you' is your idea of the subject not coming up?
)Well, when you say it like <i>that...</i>
sYou take Kaitlyn's hand and kiss the back of it. She smiles at you, but looks around the room warily all the while.
0I just want us to be able to <i>be</i> together!
3I know, me too. Ah! When did this getting so messy?
MI hate to say it, but I think today's the day. You <i>have</i> to tell Arjun.
9Kaitlyn stares at the table. Her eyes pool up with tears.
5{You}, it's not that easy. Actually, it's terrifying.
[I'm not saying it's not, I'm just saying that Kaitlyn should be <i>honest</i> with the guy.
HAnd I'm just saying that sometimes honesty <i>isn't</i> the best policy.
You guys...
QSo, what? Kaitlyn's supposed to just lie to her family and close friends forever?
KNo, but maybe she has a legitimate reason for not wanting to tell them now.
I need some air!
]She gets up and stomps off toward the exit. Arjun looks confused as Kaitlyn brushes past him.
Did I miss something... ?
EUh, just a... lady emergency. I'm gonna go see if she needs anything.
MUSIC_COLLEGE_LOVE_SAD
6You slide out of the booth and follow Kaitlyn outside.
eYou find her in the alley next to the bar, leaning against the brick wall with her head in her hands.
Kaitlyn?
(She looks up at the sound of your voice.
Kaitlyn, I'm so sorry...
She smiles weakly at you.
^It's okay, {You}. I know I've been wishy-washy about this whole thing, but you get why, right?
Actually...
It's totally understandable.
I don't really get it.
]You're scared of the reaction you're going to get from the people you've known all your life.
,I can't think of anything scarier than that.
@I don't know, {You}. Have you <i>seen</i> Blood and Breakfast 2?
\Crying next to a dumpster and still cracking jokes. That's the Kaitlyn we all know and love.
fAnd it's the Kaitlyn that Arjun, your friends back home, and your family wouldn't turn their backs on.
yYou told me before that you were different before you came to Hartfeld. And even Arjun can see how different you are now.
[Why wouldn't you want to share who you <i>really</i> are with the people who love you most?
2<pause/>Because what if they hate who I really am?
Do <i>you</i> hate it?
XOf course not! I've never felt more free... more <i>myself</i> since I came to Hartfeld.
@And no parent or childhood friend would ever fault you for that.
[Kaitlyn wipes her nose on her sleeve and smiles a little to herself. You wrap her in a hug.
EI'm sorry I pushed so hard, Kaitlyn. You wait as long as you need to.
9Yeah... but no matter what, I do need to tell Arjun soon.
XEven if it hurts his feelings, it wouldn't be as bad as letting this drag on for longer.
	Attagirl.
4You give her one last squeeze before you let her go.
'So... I don't mean to be insensitive...
4But I've been <i>dying</i> to get you alone all day.
Oh, really? Why's that?
CYou step closer to her until her back is up against the brick wall.
RHmm, listening to Arjun talk about how amazing you are just made me want you more.
}Before Kaitlyn can speak you swoop in and kiss her deeply. You put your hands on her lower back, pulling her hips toward you.
{You}... we should...
SYour hands travel lower. You squeeze her tight, and she whimpers against your kiss.
0I'm sorry, did you say something? We should... ?
FYou kiss her neck while you drag your nails lightly down her thighs...
0You hear a door open and Abbie's voice call out.
%{You}? Kaitlyn? Are you two out here?
Abbie
?You giggle and give Kaitlyn one last kiss before you back away.
$I guess we should get back in there.
1Yeah. Everyone's probably wondering where we are.
She grins at you.
CBut thanks, {You}. I am feeling a whole lot better about this mess.
	Any time.
1Abbie rounds the corner and spots the two of you.
zYou guys need to come back inside. It got awkward, and now Zack's about to tell the story of our first night in the suite.
The game of truth or truth?
&Nope! That is <i>so</i> not happening.

MUSIC_COLLEGE_ACTION_CHILL
ÄThe three of you run back inside just as Zack is starting to talk about the game you all played on your first night at Hartfeld.
Zack! Shut it!
OAw, come on guys, it's a fun story. The first time we all bonded as suitemates.
%Kaitlyn points a finger at his chest.
,What happens on the roof, stays on the roof.
SJust then, Brandon walks into the bar. He waves at you all and starts to head over.
Brandon
...
Phew, saved by the beau.
fAs soon as Brandon reaches the table, he wraps Zack up in a hug and kisses him repeatedly on the head.
*Hello to you, too. What's gotten into you?
nI can't miss you while I'm at work? Plus, I wanna remember exactly how you smell when I leave to study abroad.
$Zack, this is your <i>boyfriend?</i>
8The group turns to look at him. Kaitlyn's cheeks redden.
Yeah...
Aren't they adorable?
Is there a problem?
"You two do make a handsome couple!
II didn't realize when I met you at the cast party that you were together.
?Though, now that I think about it, it does make a lot of sense.

A problem?
\Of course not! I just didn't realize when I met you two at the party that you were a couple.
?Arjun leans conspiratorially toward Zack, gesturing at Brandon.
Good catch.
Everyone at the table breathes a sigh of relief. Everyone except Kaitlyn, who looks like she's been holding her breath forever.
DGlad to know you have good taste, Arjun. I like us as a couple, too.
/Zack stretches up to give Brandon a quick kiss.
WI'd like to have a relationship that awesome. I guess I'd need to meet someone first...
-But where would I ever find the perfect girl?
SArjun grins. When he looks over at Kaitlyn, his face falls. Her face is bright red.
Uh... Kaitlyn? Are you--
<shake_portrait/>I'M GAY.
GEveryone goes silent, looking back and forth between Kaitlyn and Arjun.
Wh-what?
!I... I'm a lesbian. I like girls.
TI'm so sorry, Arjun. This isn't how I wanted to tell you... but I had to get it out.
Wow.
Wow... ?
<i>Wow.</i>
0Arjun looks around wide-eyed at the rest of you.
-And I assume you all knew about this already?
Yeah... we did.
Everyone but me.
But it's only because...
She was scared.
You just got here!
]Your families are <i>super</i> close. Kaitlyn was just worried about it getting back to them.
'I swear, Arjun, I wanted to tell you...
rYou two may have known each other forever, but you've said yourself that you can tell there's something about her.
[And the 'something different' is that I've never felt more myself since I came to Hartfeld.
/Arjun is quiet for a moment, and then he sighs.
OIt's okay, Kaitlyn. I get it. Especially with how traditional your parents are.
.Seriously? You have no idea how relieved I am.
So... you're not mad?
Honestly, I am a little.
vI'm mad that you didn't trust me enough to tell me sooner. I know you've gotten really close with your friends here...
nBut I've known you since we were little kids. You think I'd forget all of <i>that</i> for something like this?
VNot to mention the fact that you've dragged all of your friends here as a... a buffer!
%It's not... <i>exactly</i> like that.

Yeah? Then what's it like?
It's...
%Okay, it's kind of exactly like that.
 Arjun evenly finishes his drink.
;I'm just gonna go back to my dorm. I'll see you guys later.
HArjun slides out of the booth, and your friends part to let him through.
Arjun!
 He pauses and looks back at her.
4Don't worry, Kaitlyn. I won't tell anyone back home.
0He walks out the door without another look back.
"That couldn't have gone any worse.
%I don't know. I think it went okay...
_Look on the bright side. Arjun's not into you any more, he didn't throw a drink in your face...
No one's on fire!
Kaitlyn groans.
You guys...
Have a point.
Really aren't helping.
I know it all looks bad now.
BBut there are a lot of ways this could have gone <i>way</i> worse.
>I guess that's true. He did say he wouldn't tell my parents...
IAnd he didn't cry or anything. I don't think I could take it if he cried.
 No one's on fire? Really, Tyler?
)It was the first thing that came to mind.
But he does have a point.
P<pause/>Not about the fire thing. But overall, this could have gone a lot worse.
LKaitlyn doesn't need to dwell on how things could have gone better or worse.
What's done is done.
.Guys, why don't you meet us back at the suite?
ÄEveryone takes turns giving Kaitlyn a hug before leaving the bar. As they walk away, you turn and grab Kaitlyn by the shoulders.
!Hey... you'll be okay. I promise.
?I'm going to make it my personal mission to cheer you up, okay?
You know what you need?
You need...
A makeover!
kaitlyn_makeover
A tub of ice cream!
TOuch, {You}. I feel bad enough as it is without you questioning my ensemble choices.
9No, no, I didn't mean it like that! Here, check it out...
[You dig in your purse and hand her a flyer you found on campus the other day. She skims it.
EHmm... Midnight Madness at Lulu's Boutique? I <i>love</i> that place.
(And the best part? First outfit's on me.
HThere is literally no way I could refuse. Midnight Madness here we come!
Kaitlyn groans.
>I feel like I've eaten <i>nothing</i> but ice cream this week.
3Okay. But you know what you haven't eaten all week?
Cake!
...I'm listening.
zThere's a grocery store down the street. Let's go get everything we need to bake a 'Congrats on Coming Out to Arjun' cake.
3Hmm. You had me at cake, but you lost me at baking.
You roll your eyes.
5Let's go get everything <i>I</i> need to bake a cake.
Perfect!
`You go to the store to pick up the supplies for Kaitlyn's cake before heading back to the suite.
{When you and Kaitlyn get back to the suite, Chris is in the dining room alone, hunched over a stack of papers at the table.
Big test coming up?
LThese school by-laws are so frustrating I almost wish I <i>was</i> studying.
*Getting ready for the race, Mr. President?
Starting to... What's all that?
(He points at the bag in Kaitlyn's hands.
4Just a little something to help Kaitlyn feel better.
PYour conversation is interrupted by a knock on the door. Chris answers the door.
What do <i>you</i> want?

MUSIC_COLLEGE_TENSE_ACTION
@You look up and see Sebastian standing in the doorway, grinning.
	Sebastian
/Tsk, manners. Aren't you going to invite me in?
^No way. Everyone knows once you've invited a vampire in they can come back whenever they want.
,Ah. Too bad you've invited me inside before.
CHe slips inside, and Chris begrudgingly closes the door behind him.
/Yeah, our mistake. Why are you here, Sebastian?
)The School President position, of course.
>You don't think I'm here because I enjoy your company, do you?
"What about the president position?
VWell, you see, Chris. Before you decided to campaign for it, I was the only candidate.
'And I must admit, I prefer it that way.
CSebastian reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out his checkbook.
/Are you <i>seriously</i> trying to bribe Chris?
	That's...
Despicable.
Kind of a good offer.
$Chris doesn't need your dirty money!
7Excuse us, this is a conversation between me and Chris.
,Kaitlyn and Chris both look at you, shocked.
)I'm not saying you should <i>take</i> it.
TI wouldn't. Well, okay, maybe I would if it were anyone else but Sebastian offering.
KIt doesn't matter what <i>you</i> would do, {You}. This offer is for Chris.
-What do you say Chris? How much will it take?
!I'm not taking anything from you.
KI can't let you drop out of the race for free. My integrity won't allow it.
(I'm not dropping out of the race at all.
I see.
bSebastian tucks his checkbook back in his coat pocket, while you, Kaitlyn, and Chris glare at him.
)Then you choose to lose <i>honorably.</i>
Or maybe he won't lose at all.
	Charming.
Foolish, but charming.
ESebastian opens the door and turns to speak to you over his shoulder.
bThe campaign begins tomorrow. I hope you're ready. I have a few <i>surprises</i> in store for you.
And with that, he leaves.
jHow will Chris fare on the campaign trail? Find out in the next chapter when the presidential race begins!
SOutside of Lulu's Boutique, you and Kaitlyn huddle together in the chill night air.
KWe've been here an hour, and I'm already beginning to regret this decision.
CI definitely wasn't expecting <i>this</i> many people to show up...
TYou look behind you at the line of people waiting for the store to open at midnight.
nBut it'll be great! This is the perfect opportunity to relieve some of the tension from the whole Arjun thing.
Think of it like that movie...
Falling for You.
Brutal Vengeance III.
1I don't think I've ever even heard of that movie.
*I forgot romcoms aren't really your thing.
dBut in the movie, the main character, played by Emilia Ruiz, has this really great makeover montage.
ÖAnd in the end, the blouse she bought ended up belonging to the male lead's dead wife! And Emilia ends up with the guy of her dreams.
BYuck! How lame. I will never understand people enjoy those movies.
'Anyway, is there a point to this story?
.A little retail therapy can change everything.
'Ah, I understand exactly what you mean.
*Kaitlyn looks at you and grins devilishly.
&Take no prisoners. Leave no survivors.
;A store employee blows a whistle, and the doors swing open.

Go, go, go!
OYou and Kaitlyn run in and start frantically flipping through racks of clothes.
What about this?
Too frilly! This?
$She holds up a fitted blue tank top.
It's perfect! Grab it!
rAs you flip through the rack, you pause on a leather jacket in Kaitlyn's size that matches the blue top perfectly.
'Oh my god, Kaitlyn. You've got to see--
UAs you're pulling the jacket from the rack, it's being tugged in the other direction!
MUSIC_COLLEGE_TENSE_NEW
What the hell?
JThrough the gap in the rack you see a woman holding onto the other sleeve.

I <i>need</i> that jacket!
Working on it!
(What do I do?)
Pull!
Let go!
RYou pull on the jacket sleeve with all your might but the woman refuses to let go.
<shake_portrait/>HEY!
^Kaitlyn shouts into the ear of the woman on the other side. She yelps and releases the jacket.
Yes!
VThe woman on the other side gives a sharp tug, and the jacket flies out of your hands.
 Holy crap, is that Ryan Gosling?
zKaitlyn is on the other side of the rack next to the woman. When she looks away, Kaitlyn swipes the jacket from her grasp.

Yes! You snooze, you lose!
EYou and Kaitlyn run off to the dressing room, giggling the whole way.
GThat woman was <i>pissed.</i> You were right, {You}. I feel way better.
I knew you would.
#You both duck into a dressing room.
&You didn't grab anything for yourself?
+Who said this leather jacket wasn't for me?
tKaitlyn grins and grabs it out of your hands. She pulls her shirt up over her head to try on the new top and jacket.
Wait.

,What? I wanna see how those new clothes fit.
Kaitlyn
$You take a step toward her, smiling.
1I know, but I like the way you look without them.
({You}! You haven't even seen me in them.
Kaitlyn
Details, details.
eKaitlyn laughs and moves toward you, capturing your lips with hers. She murmurs against your mouth...
-Too bad you don't have any clothes to try on.
Kaitlyn
.Doesn't mean I don't have clothes to take off.
xThere's a tiny chair in the dressing room, and you pull Kaitlyn toward it. You sit down, and Kaitlyn straddles your lap.
BWhy does it always seem like we end up in dressing rooms together?
Kaitlyn
8You laugh a little, then moan as she grinds against you.
{You}! Shh!
Kaitlyn
It's not <i>my</i> fault.
wYou and Kaitlyn laugh. You can hear the sounds of other shoppers in the dressing rooms around you, but you ignore them.
tBesides, we both know that if I did a certain something, <i>you'd</i> be the one getting us both kicked out of here.
CYou kiss her neck and chest, and your hand trails down to her hips.
;Kaitlyn grasps your hair, holding your face to her chest...

=Is there anyone in there? Other people are waiting, you know!

You groan.
tOkay, let's leave the hooking up for our dorm rooms. Doesn't seem like we can catch a moment of peace anywhere else.
WSure. But I've got to say, it's good to not have to worry about getting caught anymore.

ILike you should wear it home, because I am so excited to take it off you.
I like the sound of that.
)She spins in your arms to kiss you again.
CWe should go before the person waiting loses their mind completely.
@Like seriously, you're gonna turn heads walking down the street.
Don't I always?
wYou leave the dressing room and head up to the register. You give the cashier the clothing tags and hand him your card.
6I thought you were joking! You really don't have to...
The cashier swipes the card.
What are girlfriends for?
JKaitlyn grins and stretches up on her toes to kiss you softly on the lips.
What are friends for?
BKaitlyn throws her arms around you and pulls you into a tight hug.
jYou walk out of the store, Kaitlyn's old clothes in one of the store's shopping bags swinging at her side.
3Seriously, thank you, {You}. I feel so much better!
AI knew you would. Arjun won't stay mad at you forever, Kaitlyn...
%I know. Earlier I thought he might...
]But now that I've had some time and distance to think about it, I know that he'll forgive me.
VAnd since he's transferred to Hartfeld, I'll have plenty of time to make it up to him!
That's the spirit!
^Now, let's get back to the suite. My feet are killing me, and it's <i>way</i> past my bedtime.
5You and Kaitlyn head back in the direction of campus."
